<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by
reference to Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis, which appears on pages
29-43; Note 3, Acquisitions and Spin-Off, which appears on pages 52-54; Note 5,
Supplemental Financial Information, which appears on page 55; and Note 12,
Segment Information, which appears on pages 65-66 of the Annual Report to
Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Procter &#038; Gamble Company is focused on providing branded products of
superior quality and value to improve the lives of the world&#146;s consumers. The
Company was incorporated in Ohio in 1905, having been built from a business
founded in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble. Today, we market over 300
branded products in more than 160 countries. Unless the context indicates
otherwise, the terms the &#147;Company,&#148; &#147;we,&#148; &#147;our&#148; or &#147;us&#148; as used herein refers
to The Procter &#038; Gamble Company (the registrant) and its subsidiaries.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company manages its business in five product segments: Fabric and Home
Care; Baby and Family Care; Beauty Care; Health Care; and Snacks and Beverages.
None of these segments is highly seasonal. Many of the factors necessary for an
understanding of these five segments are similar. Operating margins of the
individual segments vary slightly due to nature of the materials and processes
used to manufacture the products, the capital intensity of the businesses and
differences in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net
sales. Net sales growth by segment is also expected to vary slightly due to
the underlying growth of the markets of each segments&#146; products. For example,
we expect the Beauty Care and Health Care segments to provide a
disproportionate percentage of overall Company net sales growth, as the market
for these products is expected to grow at a higher rate than the remaining
segments.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. The
products of the Company&#146;s business segments compete with products of many large
and small companies, including well-known global competitors. We market our
products with advertising, promotions and other vehicles to build awareness of
our brands in conjunction with an extensive sales force. We believe this
combination provides the most efficient method of marketing for these types of
products. Product quality, performance, value and packaging are also important
competitive factors.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout this Form 10-K, we incorporate by reference information from
other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q
and current reports on Form 8-K are filed electronically with the SEC. The SEC
maintains an internet site that contains these reports at: <U>http://www.sec.gov.</U>
The reports can also be accessed through links from the Company&#146;s website at:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Narrative Description of Business</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Business Model. </B>Our business model relies on the continued growth and
success of existing brands and products and the creation of new products. The
markets and industry segments in which we offer our products are highly
competitive. We work collaboratively with our customers to improve the in-store
presence of our products and win the &#147;first moment of truth&#148; &#150; when a consumer
is shopping in the store. We must also win the &#147;second moment of truth&#148; &#150; when
a consumer uses the product, evaluates how well it met his or her expectations
and whether it was a good value. We believe we must continue to provide new,
innovative products and branding to the consumer in order to grow our business.
Basic research and product development activities, designed to enable sustained
organic growth, continued to carry a high priority during the past fiscal year.
While many of the benefits from these efforts will not be realized until future
years, the Company believes these activities demonstrate its commitment to
future growth.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Key Product Categories. </B>We currently have three product categories that
each account for 10% or more of consolidated net sales. The laundry category
constituted approximately 18% of net sales for fiscal year 2004, compared to
19% in 2003 and 19% in 2002. The diaper category represents approximately 11%
of consolidated sales in 2004, compared to 12% in 2003 and 2002. The retail
hair care category accounted for approximately 11% of fiscal year 2004 net
sales, up from just over 9% in 2003 and 2002. The increase in hair care
category sales is due, in part, to the addition of Wella AG (Wella).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Key Customers. </B>Our customers include mass merchandisers, grocery stores,
membership club stores and drug stores. Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its
affiliates represent approximately 17% of our total revenue, compared to 18% in
2003 and 17% in 2002. No other customer represents more than 10% of our net
sales. Our top ten customers account for approximately 33% of total unit
volume, compared to 33% in 2003 and 35% in 2002. The nature of our business
results in no material backlog orders or contracts with the government. We
believe our practices related to working capital items for customers and
suppliers are consistent with the industry segments in which we compete.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Sources and Availability of Materials. </B>Almost all of the raw and packaging
materials used by the Company are purchased from others, some of whom are
single-source suppliers. Some raw materials, primarily chemicals, are produced
by the Company for further use in the manufacturing process. In addition, fuel
and natural gas are important commodities used in our plants and in the trucks
used to deliver our products to customers. The prices we pay for materials and
other commodities are subject to fluctuation. When prices for these items
change, we may or may not pass on the change to our customers depending on the
magnitude and expected duration of the change. We have, however, recently
announced price increases in some categories, including tissue, coffee and pet
health and nutrition, to recover increases in commodity costs. The Company
purchases and produces a substantial variety of raw and packaging materials, no
one of which is material to the Company&#146;s business taken as a whole.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Trademarks and Patents. </B>We own or have licenses under patents and
registered trademarks which are used in connection with our business in all
segments. Some of these patents or licenses cover significant product
formulation and processing of the Company&#146;s
products. The trademarks of all major products in each segment are
registered. In part, the

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Company&#146;s success can be attributed to the existence
and continued protection of these trademarks, patents and licenses.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Expenditures for Environmental Compliance. </B>Expenditures for compliance
with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are fairly
consistent from year to year and are not material to the Company. No material
change is expected in fiscal year 2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Employees. </B>The Company has approximately 110,000 employees. The increase
of approximately 12,000 employees versus the prior year is primarily related to
the addition of Wella.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net sales in the United States account for approximately 46% of total net
sales. No other individual country had net sales exceeding 10% of total net
sales. Operations outside the United States are generally characterized by the
same conditions discussed in the description of the business above and may also
be affected by additional factors including changing currency values, different
rates of inflation, economic growth and political and economic uncertainties
and disruptions. Company sales by geography for the fiscal years ended June&nbsp;30
were as follows:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Development of the Business</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The discussion below provides insight to the general development of our
business, including the material acquisitions and disposition of assets over
the past five years.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Wella. </B>In March&nbsp;2003, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire a
controlling interest in Wella from the majority shareholders. In September
2003, we completed this purchase of the shares of Wella for EUR 3.16&nbsp;billion
(approximately $3.42&nbsp;billion based on exchange rates on that date).
Additionally, in September&nbsp;2003, we purchased shares secured
through a tender offer to remaining shareholders for EUR 1.49&nbsp;billion
(approximately $1.67

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">billion based on exchange rates on that date). As a result
of these purchases, the Company acquired approximately 81% of the outstanding
Wella shares (99% of the voting class shares and 45% of the preference shares).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2004, the Company and Wella entered into a Domination and Profit
Transfer Agreement (the Domination Agreement). Under the Domination Agreement,
we are entitled to exercise full operating control and receive 100% of the
future earnings of Wella. As consideration for the Domination Agreement, we
will pay the holders of the remaining outstanding shares of Wella a guaranteed
annual dividend payment. Alternatively, the remaining Wella shareholders may
elect to tender their shares to the Company for an agreed price. The fair
value of the total guaranteed annual dividend payments is $1.11&nbsp;billion, which
is the approximate cost if all remaining shares were tendered.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acquisition of Wella was financed by a mixture of available cash
balances and debt. Wella is a leading beauty care company selling its products
in more than 150 countries, focused on professional hair care, retail hair care
and cosmetics and fragrances.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Hutchison</B>. In June&nbsp;2004, we purchased the remaining 20% stake of our
China venture from our partner, Hutchison Whampoa China Ltd. (Hutchison),
giving the Company full ownership of our operations in China. The net purchase
price was $1.85&nbsp;billion, which is the purchase price of $2.00&nbsp;billion net of
minority interest and certain obligations that were eliminated as a result of
the transaction. The acquisition was funded by debt.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Jif/Crisco. </B>During May&nbsp;2002, we completed the spin-off of the Jif peanut
butter and Crisco shortening brands to the Company&#146;s shareholders and their
subsequent merger into The J.M. Smucker Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Clairol. </B>In November&nbsp;2001, we completed the acquisition of the Clairol
business from The Bristol-Myers Squibb Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Restructuring Program. </B>In 1999, the Company announced its intention to
transition from its previous geographic-based structure to a product-based
global business unit structure. Concurrent with that change, we initiated a
multi-year restructuring program, a discussion of which is incorporated herein
by reference to Note 2, Restructuring Program, which appears on page 52 of the
Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30, 2004.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Item&nbsp;2. <U>Properties.</U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States, the Company owns and operates 37 manufacturing
facilities located in 21 different states. In addition, the Company owns and
operates 99 manufacturing facilities in 42 other countries. Many of the
domestic and international facilities produce products for multiple business
segments. Fabric and Home Care products are produced at 43 of these locations;
Baby and Family Care products at 31; Health Care products at 22; Beauty Care
products at 64; and Snacks and Beverages products at 11. Management believes
that the Company&#146;s production facilities are adequate to support the business
efficiently and that the properties and equipment have been well maintained.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Item&nbsp;3. <U>Legal Proceedings.</U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is involved in clean-up efforts at off-site Superfund
locations, many of which are in the preliminary stages of investigation. The
amount accrued at the end of June&nbsp;30, 2004, representing the Company&#146;s probable
future costs that can be reasonably estimated, was $8&nbsp;million.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is also involved in certain other environmental proceedings.
No such proceeding is expected to result in material monetary or other
sanctions being imposed by any governmental entity, or in other material
liabilities. In 2003 and thereafter, The Folger Coffee Company, a subsidiary
of the Company, voluntarily contacted the Louisiana Department of Environmental
Quality (LDEQ)&nbsp;concerning compliance with certain air emission permit
requirements at its New Orleans coffee processing plant. As a result of these
self-disclosures, the subsidiary expects to receive from the LDEQ an
Administrative Order on Consent and anticipates negotiating an agreed penalty
with the agency to resolve these issues. No judicial proceeding is pending.
The Company&#146;s liability is estimated not to exceed $260,000.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive, A.G.
Lafley, and the Company&#146;s Chief Financial Officer, Clayton C. Daley, Jr., have
evaluated the Company&#146;s internal control and disclosure control systems as of
the end of the period covered by this report.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Messrs.&nbsp;Lafley and Daley have concluded that the Company&#146;s disclosure
control systems are functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance
that the Company can meet its disclosure obligations. The Company&#146;s disclosure
control system is based upon a global chain of financial, staff and general
business reporting lines that converge in the worldwide headquarters of the
Company in Cincinnati, Ohio. The reporting process is designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits with the Commission is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the Commission&#146;s rules and forms.
Consistent with SEC suggestion, the Company has formed a Disclosure Committee
consisting of key Company personnel designed to review the accuracy and
completeness of all disclosures made by the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the evaluation described above, no changes in the
Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting occurred during the
Company&#146;s fourth fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company&#146;s internal control over financial
reporting.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><U>The Procter &#038; Gamble 1992 Stock Plan (Belgian Version)</U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective February&nbsp;14, 1997, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors approved The
Procter &#038; Gamble 1992 Stock Plan (Belgian Version). Although the plan has not
been submitted to shareholders for approval, the plan is nearly identical to
The Procter &#038; Gamble 1992 Stock Plan, approved by the Company&#146;s shareholders on
October&nbsp;13, 1992, except for a few minor changes designed to comply with the
Belgian tax laws. Although no further grants can be made under the plan,
unexercised stock options previously granted under this plan remain
outstanding.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan is a stock incentive plan designed to attract, retain and
motivate key Belgian employees. Under the plan, eligible participants may be
granted or offered the right to purchase stock options, may be granted stock
appreciation rights and/or may be granted shares of the Company&#146;s common stock.
Except in the case of death of the recipient, all stock options and stock
appreciation rights must vest in no less than one year from the date of grant
and must expire no later than fifteen years from the date of grant. The
exercise price for all stock options granted under the plan is the average
price of the Company&#146;s stock on the date of grant. If a recipient of a grant
leaves the Company while holding an unexercised option or right, any
unexercisable portions immediately become void, except in the case of death,
and any exercisable portions become void within one month of departure, except
in the case of death or retirement. Any common stock awarded under the plan
may be subject to restrictions on sale or transfer while the recipient is
employed, as the committee administering the plan may determine.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><U>The Procter &#038; Gamble Future Shares Plan</U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;14, 1997, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors approved The Procter
&#038; Gamble Future Shares Plan pursuant to which options to purchase shares of the
Company&#146;s common stock may be granted to employees worldwide. The purpose of
this plan is to advance the interests of the Company by giving substantially
all employees a stake in the Company&#146;s future growth and success and to
strengthen the alignment of interests between employees and the Company&#146;s
shareholders through increased ownership of shares of the Company&#146;s stock. The
plan has not been submitted to shareholders for approval.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to adjustment for changes in the Company&#146;s capitalization, the
number of shares to be granted under the plan is not to exceed 17&nbsp;million
shares. Under the plan&#146;s regulations, recipients are granted options to
acquire 100 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock at an exercise price equal to
the average price of the Company&#146;s common stock on the date of the grant.
These options vest five years after the date of grant and expire ten years
following the date of grant. If a recipient leaves the employ of the Company

        The Procter & Gamble 2001 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan,
              and related correspondence and terms and conditions
<PAGE>

         THE PROCTER & GAMBLE 2001 STOCK AND INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN
            (AS APPROVED BY THE SHAREHOLDERS ON OCTOBER 9, 2001 AND
                           AMENDED DECEMBER 10, 2002)


ARTICLE A -- PURPOSE.

         The purposes of The Procter & Gamble 2001 Stock and Incentive
Compensation Plan (the "Plan") are to strengthen the alignment of interests
between those employees of The Procter & Gamble Company (the "Company") and its
subsidiaries who are largely responsible for the success of the business (the
"Participants") and the Company's shareholders through ownership behavior and
the increased ownership of shares of the Company's common stock (the "Common
Stock"), and to encourage the Participants to remain in the employ of the
Company and its subsidiaries. This will be accomplished through the granting of
options to purchase shares of Common Stock, the granting of performance related
awards, the payment of a portion of the Participants' remuneration in shares of
Common Stock, the granting of deferred awards related to the increase in the
price of Common Stock, and the granting of restricted stock units ("RSUs") or
other awards that are related to the price of Common Stock.

ARTICLE B -- ADMINISTRATION.

         1. The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee (the
"Committee") of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"), or such
other committee as may be designated by the Board. The Committee shall consist
of not fewer than three (3) members of the Board who are "Non-Employee
Directors" as defined in Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the "1934 Act"), or any successor rule or definition adopted by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, to be appointed by the Board from time to
time and to serve at the discretion of the Board. The Committee may establish
such regulations, provisions, and procedures within the terms of the Plan as, in
its opinion, may be advisable for the administration and operation of the Plan,
and may designate the Secretary of the Company or other employees of the Company
to assist the Committee in the administration and operation of the Plan and may
grant authority to such persons to execute documents on behalf of the Committee.
The Committee shall report to the Board on the administration of the Plan not
less than once each year.

         2. Subject to the express provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall
have authority: to grant nonstatutory and incentive stock options; to grant
stock appreciation rights either freestanding or in tandem with simultaneously
granted stock options; to grant Performance Awards (as defined in Article J); to
award a portion of a Participant's remuneration in shares of Common Stock
subject to such conditions or restrictions, if any, as the Committee may
determine; to award RSUs or other awards that are related to the price of Common
Stock; to determine all the terms and provisions of the respective stock option,
stock appreciation right, stock award, RSU, or other award agreements including
setting the dates when each stock option or stock appreciation right or part
thereof may be exercised and determining the conditions and restrictions, if
any, of any shares of Common Stock acquired through the exercise of any stock
option; to provide for special terms for any stock options, stock appreciation
rights, stock awards, RSUs or other awards granted to Participants who are
foreign nationals or who are employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries
outside of the United States of America in order to fairly accommodate for
differences in local law, tax policy or custom and to approve such supplements
to or amendments, restatements or alternative versions of the Plan as the
Committee may consider necessary or appropriate for such purposes (without
affecting the terms of the Plan for any other purpose); and to make all other
determinations it deems necessary or advisable for administering the Plan. In
addition, at the time of grant the Committee shall have the further authority
to:

         (a) waive the provisions of Article F, Paragraph 1(a);

<PAGE>

         (b)  waive the provisions of Article F, Paragraph 1(b);

         (c)  waive the provisions of Article G, Paragraph 4(a), 4(b) and 4(c);
              and

         (d)  impose conditions in lieu of those set forth in Article G,
              Paragraphs 4 through 7, for nonstatutory stock options, stock
              appreciation rights, stock awards, or Performance Awards which do
              not increase or extend the rights of the Participant.

ARTICLE C -- PARTICIPATION.

         The Committee shall select as Participants those employees of the
Company and its subsidiaries who, in the opinion of the Committee, have
demonstrated a capacity for contributing in a substantial manner to the success
of such companies.

ARTICLE D -- LIMITATION ON NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE UNDER THE PLAN.

         1. Unless otherwise authorized by the shareholders and subject to
Paragraph 2 of this Article D, the maximum aggregate number of shares available
for award under the Plan shall be ninety-five million shares. Any of the
authorized shares may be used for any of the types of awards described in the
Plan, except that no more than fifteen percent (15%) of the authorized shares
may be awarded as restricted or unrestricted stock.

         2. In addition to the shares authorized for award by Paragraph 1 of
this Article, the following shares may be awarded under the Plan:

              (a) shares that were authorized to be awarded under The Procter &
Gamble 1992 Stock Plan (the "1992 Plan"), but that were not awarded under the
1992 Plan;

              (b) shares awarded under the Plan or the 1992 Plan that are
subsequently forfeited in accordance with the Plan or the 1992 Plan,
respectively;

              (c) shares tendered by a Participant in payment of all or part of
the exercise price of a stock option awarded under the Plan or the 1992 Plan;

              (d) shares tendered by or withheld from a Participant in
satisfaction of withholding tax obligations with respect to a stock option
awarded under the Plan or the 1992 Plan.

ARTICLE E -- SHARES SUBJECT TO USE UNDER THE PLAN.

         1. The shares to be delivered by the Company upon exercise of stock
options or stock appreciation rights shall be determined by the Board and may
consist, in whole or in part, of authorized but unissued shares or treasury
shares. In the case of redemption of stock appreciation rights by one of the
Company's subsidiaries, such shares shall be shares acquired by that subsidiary.

         2. For purposes of the Plan, restricted or unrestricted stock awarded
under the terms of the Plan shall be authorized but unissued shares, treasury
shares, or shares acquired in the open market by the Company or a subsidiary, as
determined by the Board.

ARTICLE F -- STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.

         1. In addition to such other conditions as may be established by the
Committee, in consideration of the granting of stock options or stock
appreciation rights under the terms of the Plan, each Participant agrees as
follows:

         (a)  The right to exercise any stock option or stock appreciation right
              shall be conditional upon certification by the Participant at time
              of exercise that the Participant intends to remain in the employ
              of the Company or one of its subsidiaries for at least one (1)
              year following the date of the exercise of the stock option or
              stock appreciation right (provided that termination of employment
              due to Retirement or Special Separation shall not constitute a
              breach of such certification), and,

         (b)  In order to better protect the goodwill of the Company and its
              subsidiaries and to prevent the disclosure of the Company's or its
              subsidiaries' trade secrets and confidential information and
              thereby help insure the long-term success of the business, the
              Participant, without prior written consent of the Company, will
              not engage in any activity or provide any services, whether as a
              director, manager, supervisor, employee, adviser, consultant or
              otherwise, for a period of three (3) years following the date of
              the Participant's termination of employment with the Company
              (except for terminations of employment resulting from Retirement
              or Special Separation), in connection with the manufacture,
              development, advertising, promotion, or sale of any product which
              is the same as or similar to or competitive with any products of
              the Company or its subsidiaries (including both existing products
              as well as products known to the Participant, as a consequence of
              the Participant's employment with the Company or one of its
              subsidiaries, to be in development):

              (1)  with respect to which the Participant's work has been
                   directly concerned at any time during the two (2) years
                   preceding termination of employment with the Company or one
                   of its subsidiaries or

              (2)  with respect to which during that period of time the
                   Participant, as a consequence of the Participant's job
                   performance and duties, acquired knowledge of trade secrets
                   or other confidential information of the Company or its
                   subsidiaries.

              For purposes of this paragraph, it shall be conclusively presumed
              that Participants have knowledge of information they were directly
              exposed to through actual receipt or review of memos or documents
              containing such information, or through actual attendance at
              meetings at which such information was discussed or disclosed.

         (c)  The provisions of this Article are not in lieu of, but are in
              addition to the continuing obligation of the Participant (which
              Participant hereby acknowledges) to not use or disclose the
              Company's or its subsidiaries' trade secrets and confidential
              information known to the Participant until any particular trade
              secret or confidential information become generally known (through
              no fault of the Participant), whereupon the restriction on use and
              disclosure shall cease as to that item. Information regarding
              products in development, in test marketing or being marketed or
              promoted in a discrete geographic region, which information the
              Company or one of its subsidiaries is considering for broader use,
              shall not be deemed generally known until such broader use is
              actually commercially implemented. As used in this Article,
              "generally known" means known throughout the domestic U. S.
              industry or, in the case of Participants who have job
              responsibilities outside of the United States, the appropriate
              foreign country or countries' industry.

<PAGE>


         (d)  By acceptance of any offered stock option or stock appreciation
              rights granted under the terms of the Plan, the Participant
              acknowledges that if the Participant were, without authority, to
              use or disclose the Company's or any of its subsidiaries' trade
              secrets or confidential information or threaten to do so, the
              Company or one of its subsidiaries would be entitled to injunctive
              and other appropriate relief to prevent the Participant from doing
              so. The Participant acknowledges that the harm caused to the
              Company by the breach or anticipated breach of this Article is by
              its nature irreparable because, among other things, it is not
              readily susceptible of proof as to the monetary harm that would
              ensue. The Participant consents that any interim or final
              equitable relief entered by a court of competent jurisdiction
              shall, at the request of the Company or one of its subsidiaries,
              be entered on consent and enforced by any court having
              jurisdiction over the Participant, without prejudice to any rights
              either party may have to appeal from the proceedings which
              resulted in any grant of such relief.

         (e)  If any of the provisions contained in this Article shall for any
              reason, whether by application of existing law or law which may
              develop after the Participant's acceptance of an offer of the
              granting of stock appreciation rights or stock options, be
              determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be overly broad
              as to scope of activity, duration, or territory, the Participant
              agrees to join the Company or any of its subsidiaries in
              requesting such court to construe such provision by limiting or
              reducing it so as to be enforceable to the extent compatible with
              then applicable law. If any one or more of the terms, provisions,
              covenants, or restrictions of this Article shall be determined by
              a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or
              unenforceable, then the remainder of the terms, provisions,
              covenants, and restrictions of this Article shall remain in full
              force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired, or
              invalidated.

         2. The fact that a Participant has been granted a stock option or a
stock appreciation right under the Plan shall not limit the right of the
employer to terminate the Participant's employment at any time. The Committee is
authorized to suspend or terminate any outstanding stock option or stock
appreciation right for actions taken by a Participant prior to termination of
employment if the Committee determines the Participant has acted significantly
contrary to the best interests of the Company or its subsidiaries.

         3. The maximum number of shares with respect to which stock options or
stock appreciation rights may be granted to any Participant in any calendar year
shall not exceed 1,000,000 shares.

         4. The aggregate fair market value (determined at the time when the
incentive stock option is exercisable for the first time by a Participant during
any calendar year) of the shares for which any Participant may be granted
incentive stock options under the Plan and all other stock option plans of the
Company and its subsidiaries in any calendar year shall not exceed $100,000 (or
such other amount as reflected in the limits imposed by Section 422(d) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as it may be amended from time to time).

         5. If the Committee grants incentive stock options, all such stock
options shall contain such provisions as permit them to qualify as "incentive
stock options" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as may be amended from time to time.

         6. With respect to stock options granted in tandem with stock
appreciation rights, the exercise of either such stock options or such stock
appreciation rights will result in the simultaneous cancellation of the same
number of tandem stock appreciation rights or stock options, as the case may be.

<PAGE>


         7. The exercise price for all stock options and stock appreciation
rights shall be established by the Committee at the time of their grant and
shall be not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the fair market value of
the Common Stock on the date of grant.

         8. Unless otherwise authorized by the shareholders of the Company,
neither the Board nor the Committee shall authorize the amendment of any
outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right to reduce the exercise
price.

         9. No stock option or stock appreciation right shall be cancelled and
replaced with awards having a lower exercise price without the prior approval of
the shareholders of the Company. This Article F, Paragraph 9 is intended to
prohibit the repricing of "underwater" stock options and stock appreciation
rights and shall not be construed to prohibit the adjustments permitted under
Article J of the Plan.

         10. The Committee may require any Participant to accept any stock
options or stock appreciation rights by means of electronic signature.

ARTICLE G -- EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.

         1. All stock options and stock appreciation rights granted hereunder
shall have a maximum life of no more than ten (10) years from the date of grant.

         2. No stock options or stock appreciation rights shall be exercisable
within one (1) year from their date of grant, except in the case of the death of
the Participant.

         3. Unless a transfer has been duly authorized by the Committee pursuant
to Article G, Paragraph 6 of the Plan, during the lifetime of the Participant,
stock options and stock appreciation rights may be exercised only by the
Participant personally, or, in the event of the legal incompetence of the
Participant, by the Participant's duly appointed legal guardian.

         4. In the event that a Participant ceases to be an employee of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries while holding an unexercised stock option or
stock appreciation right:

         (a)  Any unexercisable portions thereof are then void, except in the
              case of: (1) death of the Participant; (2) Retirement or Special
              Separation that occurs more than six months from the date the
              options were granted; or (3) any option as to which the Committee
              has waived, at the time of grant, the provisions of this Article
              G, Paragraph 4(a).

         (b)  Any exercisable portions thereof are then void, except in the case
              of: (1) death of the Participant; (2) Retirement or Special
              Separation; or (3) any option as to which the Committee has
              waived, at the time of grant, the provisions of this Article G,
              Paragraph 4(b).

         (c)  In the case of Special Separation, any stock option or stock
              appreciation right must be exercised within the time specified in
              the original grant or five (5) years from the date of Special
              Separation, whichever is shorter.

         5. In the case of the death of a Participant, the persons to whom the
stock options or stock appreciation rights have been transferred by will or the
laws of descent and distribution shall have the privilege of exercising
remaining stock options, stock appreciation rights or parts thereof, whether or
not exercisable on the date of death of such Participant, at any time prior to
the expiration date of the stock options or stock appreciation rights.

<PAGE>


         6. Stock options and stock appreciation rights are not transferable
other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. For the purpose
of exercising stock options or stock appreciation rights after the death of the
Participant, the duly appointed executors and administrators of the estate of
the deceased Participant shall have the same rights with respect to the stock
options and stock appreciation rights as legatees or distributees would have
after distribution to them from the Participant's estate. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Committee may authorize the transfer of stock options and stock
appreciation rights upon such terms and conditions as the Committee may require.
Such transfer shall become effective only upon the Committee's complete
satisfaction that the proposed transferee has strictly complied with such terms
and conditions, and both the original Participant and the transferee shall be
subject to the same terms and conditions hereunder as the original Participant.

         7. Upon the exercise of stock appreciation rights, the Participant
shall be entitled to receive a redemption differential for each such stock
appreciation right which shall be the difference between the then fair market
value of one share of Common Stock and the exercise price of one stock
appreciation right then being exercised. In the case of the redemption of stock
appreciation rights by a subsidiary of the Company not located in the United
States, the redemption differential shall be calculated in United States dollars
and converted to the appropriate local currency on the exercise date. As
determined by the Committee, the redemption differential may be paid in cash,
Common Stock to be valued at its fair market value on the date of exercise, any
other mode of payment deemed appropriate by the Committee or any combination
thereof.

         8. Time spent on leave of absence shall be considered as employment for
the purposes of the Plan. Leave of absence means any period of time away from
work granted to any employee by his or her employer because of illness, injury,
or other reasons satisfactory to the employer.

         9. The Company reserves the right from time to time to suspend the
exercise of any stock option or stock appreciation right where such suspension
is deemed by the Company as necessary or appropriate for corporate purposes. No
such suspension shall extend the life of the stock option or stock appreciation
right beyond its expiration date, and in no event will there be a suspension in
the five (5) calendar days immediately preceding the expiration date.

         10. The Committee may require any Participant to exercise any stock
options or stock appreciation rights by means of electronic signature.

ARTICLE H -- PAYMENT FOR STOCK OPTIONS AND TAX WITHHOLDING.

         Upon the exercise of a stock option, payment in full of the exercise
price shall be made by the Participant. As determined by the Committee, the
stock option exercise price may be paid by the Participant either in cash,
shares of Common Stock valued at their fair market value on the date of
exercise, a combination thereof, or such other method as determined by the
Committee. In addition to payment of the exercise price, the Committee may
authorize the Company to charge a reasonable administrative fee for the exercise
of any stock option. Furthermore, to the extent the Company is required to
withhold federal, state, local or foreign taxes in connection with any
Participant's stock option exercise, the Committee may require the Participant
to make such arrangements as the Company may deem necessary for the payment of
such taxes required to be withheld (including, without limitation,
relinquishment of a portion of such stock options or relinquishment of a portion
of the proceeds received by the Participant in a simultaneous exercise and sale
of stock during a "cashless" exercise). In no event, however, shall the
Committee be permitted to require payment from a Participant in excess of the
maximum required tax withholding rates.

<PAGE>


ARTICLE I -- GRANT OF UNRESTRICTED OR RESTRICTED STOCK.

         The Committee may grant Common Stock to Participants under the Plan
subject to such conditions or restrictions, if any, as the Committee may
determine. To the extent the Company is required to withhold federal, state,
local or foreign taxes in connection with the lapse of restrictions on any
Participant's shares of Common Stock, the Committee may require the Participant
to make such arrangements as the Company may deem necessary for the payment of
such taxes required to be withheld (including, without limitation,
relinquishment of a portion of such shares of Common Stock). In no event,
however, shall the Committee be permitted to require payment from a Participant
in excess of the maximum required tax withholding rates.

ARTICLE J -- PERFORMANCE RELATED AWARDS.

         1. The Committee, in its discretion, may establish performance goals
for selected Participants and authorize the granting of cash, stock options,
stock appreciation rights, Common Stock, RSUs or other awards that are related
to the price of Common Stock, other property, or any combination thereof
("Performance Awards") to such Participants upon achievement of such established
performance goals during a specified time period (the "Performance Period"). The
Committee, in its discretion, shall determine the Participants eligible for
Performance Awards, the performance goals to be achieved during each Performance
Period, the amount of any Performance Awards to be paid, and the method of
payment for any Performance Awards. Performance Awards may be granted either
alone or in addition to other grants made under the Plan.

         2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Performance Awards granted to the
Chief Executive and the Company's other four highest paid executive officers (as
reported in the Company's proxy statement pursuant to Regulation S-K, Item
402(a)(3)) under Article J, Paragraph 1 shall comply with all of the following
requirements:

         (a) Each grant shall specify the specific performance objectives (the
"Performance Objectives") which, if achieved, will result in payment or early
payment of the Performance Award. The Performance Objectives may be described in
terms of Company-wide objectives that are related to the individual Participant
or objectives that are related to a subsidiary, division, department, region,
function or business unit of the Company in which the Participant is employed,
and may consist of one or more or any combination of the following criteria:
stock price, market share, sales revenue, cash flow, earnings per share, return
on equity, total shareholder return, gross margin, and/or costs. The Performance
Objectives may be made relative to the performance of other corporations. The
Committee, in its discretion, may change or modify these criteria, however, at
all times the criterion must be valid performance criterion for purposes of
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
The Committee may not change the criteria or Performance Objectives for any
Performance Period that has already been approved by the Committee. The
Committee may cancel a Performance Period or replace a Performance Period with a
new Performance Period, provided that any such cancellation or replacement shall
not cause the Performance Award to fail to meet the requirements of Section
162(m) of the Code.

         (b) Each grant shall specify the minimum level of achievement required
by the Participant relative to the Performance Objectives to qualify for a
Performance Award. In doing so, the grant shall establish a formula for
determining the percentage of the Performance Award to be awarded if performance
is at or above the minimum level, but falls short of full achievement of the
specified Performance Objectives. Each grant may also establish a formula for
determining an additional award above and beyond the Performance Award to be
granted to the Participant if performance is at or above the specified
Performance Objectives. Such additional award shall also be established as a
percentage of

<PAGE>


the Performance Award. The Committee may decrease a Performance Award as
determined by the Performance Objectives, but in no case may the Committee
increase any Performance Award as determined by the Performance Objectives.

         (c) The maximum Performance Award that may be granted to any
Participant for any one-year Performance Period shall not exceed $20,000,000 or
400,000 shares of Common Stock (the "Annual Maximum"). The maximum Performance
Award that may be granted to any Participant for a Performance Period greater
than one year shall not exceed the Annual Maximum multiplied by the number of
full years in the Performance Period.

ARTICLE K -- ADJUSTMENTS.

         In the event of any future reorganization, recapitalization, stock
split, stock dividend, combination of shares, merger, consolidation, rights
offering, share exchange, reclassification, distribution, spin-off or other
change affecting the corporate structure, capitalization or Common Stock of the
Company occurring after the date of approval of the Plan by the Company's
shareholders, (i) the amount of shares authorized to be issued under the Plan
and (ii) the number of shares and/or the exercise prices covered by outstanding
stock options and stock appreciation rights shall be adjusted appropriately and
equitably to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights under the Plan. Following
any such change, the term "Common Stock" shall be deemed to refer to such class
of shares or other securities as may be applicable.

ARTICLE L -- ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS AND DEFINITIONS.

         1. The Board may, at any time, repeal the Plan or may amend it except
that no such amendment may amend this paragraph, increase the total aggregate
number of shares subject to the Plan, reduce the price at which stock options or
stock appreciation rights may be granted or exercised, alter the class of
employees eligible to receive stock options, or increase the percentage of
shares authorized to be transferred as restricted or unrestricted stock.
Participants and the Company shall be bound by any such amendments as of their
effective dates, but if any outstanding stock options or stock appreciation
rights are materially affected adversely, notice thereof shall be given to the
Participants holding such stock options and stock appreciation rights and such
amendments shall not be applicable without such Participant's written consent.
If the Plan is repealed in its entirety, all theretofore granted unexercised
stock options or stock appreciation rights shall continue to be exercisable in
accordance with their terms and shares subject to conditions or restrictions
granted pursuant to the Plan shall continue to be subject to such conditions or
restrictions.

         2. In the case of a Participant who is an employee of a subsidiary of
the Company, performance under the Plan, including the granting of shares of the
Company, may be by the subsidiary. Nothing in the Plan shall affect the right of
the Company or any subsidiary to terminate the employment of any employee with
or without cause. None of the Participants, either individually or as a group,
and no beneficiary, transferee or other person claiming under or through any
Participant, shall have any right, title, or interest in any shares of the
Company purchased or reserved for the purpose of the Plan except as to such
shares, if any, as shall have been granted or transferred to him or her. Nothing
in the Plan shall preclude the awarding or granting of shares of the Company to
employees under any other plan or arrangement now or hereafter in effect.

         3. "Subsidiary" means any company in which more than fifty percent
(50%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock is owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Company or, if the company does not issue stock,
more than fifty percent (50%) of the total combined ownership interest is owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Company. In addition, the Board may designate for
participation in

<PAGE>


the Plan as a "subsidiary," except for the granting of incentive stock options,
those additional companies affiliated with the Company in which the Company's
direct or indirect stock ownership is fifty percent (50%) or less of the total
combined voting power of all classes of such company's stock, or, if the company
does not issue stock, the Company's direct or indirect ownership is fifty
percent (50%) or less of the company's total combined ownership interest.

         4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, stock options
and stock appreciation rights granted hereunder shall vest immediately and any
conditions or restrictions on Common Stock shall lapse upon a "Change in
Control." A "Change in Control" shall mean the occurrence of any of the
following:

         (a)  An acquisition (other than directly from the Company) of any
              voting securities of the Company (the "Voting Securities") by any
              "Person" (as the term person is used for purposes of Section 13(d)
              or 14(d) of the Exchange Act), immediately after which such Person
              has "Beneficial Ownership" (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3
              promulgated under the Exchange Act) of twenty percent (20%) or
              more of the then outstanding shares or the combined voting power
              of the Company's then outstanding Voting Securities; provided,
              however, in determining whether a Change in Control has occurred
              pursuant to this Paragraph 4(a), shares or Voting Securities which
              are acquired in a "Non-Control Acquisition" (as hereinafter
              defined) shall not constitute an acquisition which would cause a
              Change in Control. A "Non-Control Acquisition" shall mean an
              acquisition by (i) an employee benefit plan (or a trust forming a
              part thereof) maintained by (A) the Company or (B) any corporation
              or other Person of which a majority of its voting power or its
              voting equity securities or equity interest is owned, directly or
              indirectly, by the Company (for purposes of this definition, a
              "Related Entity"), (ii) the Company or any Related Entity, or
              (iii) any Person in connection with a "Non-Control Transaction"
              (as hereinafter defined);

         (b)  The individuals who, as of July 10, 2001 are members of the Board
              (the "Incumbent Board"), cease for any reason to constitute at
              least half of the members of the Board; or, following a Merger (as
              hereinafter defined) which results in a Parent Corporation (as
              hereinafter defined), the board of directors of the ultimate
              Parent Corporation; provided, however, that if the election, or
              nomination for election by the Company's common stockholders, of
              any new director was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of
              the Incumbent Board, such new director shall, for purposes of the
              Plan, be considered as a member of the Incumbent Board; provided
              further, however, that no individual shall be considered a member
              of the Incumbent Board if such individual initially assumed office
              as a result of either an actual or threatened "Election Contest"
              (as described in Rule 14a-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act)
              or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents
              by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board (a "Proxy
              Contest") including by reason of any agreement intended to avoid
              or settle any Election Contest or Proxy Contest; or

         (c)  The consummation of:

              (i)  A merger, consolidation or reorganization with or into the
                   Company or in which securities of the Company are issued (a
                   "Merger"), unless such Merger is a "Non-Control Transaction."
                   A "Non-Control Transaction" shall mean a Merger where:

                   (A) the stockholders of the Company, immediately before such
                       Merger own directly or indirectly immediately following
                       such Merger at least fifty percent (50%) of the combined
                       voting power of the outstanding voting securities of (x)
                       the corporation resulting from such Merger (the
                       "Surviving Corporation") if fifty

<PAGE>


                        percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of
                        the then outstanding voting securities of the Surviving
                        Corporation is not Beneficially Owned, directly or
                        indirectly by another Person (a "Parent Corporation"),
                        or (y) if there is one or more Parent Corporations, the
                        ultimate Parent Corporation;

                    (B) the individuals who were members of the Incumbent Board
                        immediately prior to the execution of the agreement
                        providing for such Merger constitute at least half of
                        the members of the board of directors of (x) the
                        Surviving Corporation, if there is no Parent
                        Corporation, or (y) if there is one or more Parent
                        Corporations, the ultimate Parent Corporation; and

                    (C) no Person other than (1) the Company, (2) any Related
                        Entity, (3) any employee benefit plan (or any trust
                        forming a part thereof) that, immediately prior to such
                        Merger was maintained by the Company or any Related
                        Entity, or (4) any Person who, immediately prior to such
                        merger, consolidation or reorganization had Beneficial
                        Ownership of twenty percent (20%) or more of the then
                        outstanding Voting Securities or shares, has Beneficial
                        Ownership of twenty percent (20%) or more of the
                        combined voting power of the outstanding voting
                        securities or common stock of (x) the Surviving
                        Corporation if there is no Parent Corporation, or (y) if
                        there is one or more Parent Corporations, the ultimate
                        Parent Corporation;

              (ii)  A complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company; or

              (iii) The sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of
                    the assets of the Company to any Person (other than a
                    transfer to a Related Entity or under conditions that would
                    constitute a Non-Control Transaction with the disposition of
                    assets being regarded as a Merger for this purpose or the
                    distribution to the Company's stockholders of the stock of a
                    Related Entity or any other assets).

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not be deemed
to occur solely because any Person (the "Subject Person") acquired Beneficial
Ownership of more than the permitted amount of the then outstanding shares or
Voting Securities as a result of the acquisition of shares or Voting Securities
by the Company which, by reducing the number of shares or Voting Securities then
outstanding, increases the proportional number of shares Beneficially Owned by
the Subject Persons, provided that if a Change in Control would occur (but for
the operation of this sentence) as a result of the acquisition of shares or
Voting Securities by the Company, and after such share acquisition by the
Company, the Subject Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of any additional
shares or Voting Securities which increases the percentage of the then
outstanding shares or Voting Securities Beneficially Owned by the Subject
Person, then a Change in Control shall occur.

         5. The term "Special Separation" shall mean any termination of
employment that occurs prior to the time a Participant is eligible to retire,
except a termination for cause or a voluntary resignation that is not initiated
or encouraged by the Company.

         6. The term "Retirement" shall mean: (a) retirement in accordance with
the provisions of any appropriate retirement plan of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries; or (b) termination of employment under the permanent disability
provision of any retirement plan of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

ARTICLE M -- CONSENT.

         Every Participant who receives a stock option, stock appreciation
right, or grant of shares pursuant to the Plan shall be bound by the terms and
provisions of the Plan and of the stock option, stock appreciation right, or
grant of shares agreement referable thereto, and the acceptance of any stock
option, stock appreciation right, or grant of shares pursuant to the Plan shall
constitute a binding agreement between the Participant and the Company and its
subsidiaries and any successors in interest to any of them. Every Person who
receives a stock option, stock appreciation right, or grant of shares from a
Participant pursuant to the Plan shall, in addition to such terms and conditions
as the Committee may require upon such grant, be bound by the terms and
provisions of the Plan and of the stock option, stock appreciation right, or
grant of shares agreement referable thereto, and the acceptance of any stock

governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio,
United States of America.

ARTICLE N -- PURCHASE OF SHARES OR STOCK OPTIONS.

         The Committee may authorize any Participant to convert cash
compensation otherwise payable to such Participant into stock options or shares
of Common Stock under the Plan upon such terms and conditions as the Committee,
in its discretion, shall determine. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any such
conversion the shares of Common Stock shall be valued at no less than one
hundred percent (100%) of their fair market value.

ARTICLE O -- DURATION OF PLAN.

         The Plan will terminate on July 10, 2011 unless a different termination
date is fixed by the shareholders or by action of the Board of Directors, but no
such termination shall affect the prior rights under the Plan of the Company (or
any subsidiary) or of anyone to whom stock options or stock appreciation rights
were granted prior thereto or to whom shares have been transferred prior to such
termination.

                             ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

1.       SHARES AWARDED AS A PORTION OF REMUNERATION

         Any shares of Common Stock of the Company awarded as a portion of a
participant's remuneration shall be valued at not less than one hundred percent
(100%) of the fair market value of the Company's Common Stock on the date of the
award. These shares may be subject to such conditions or restrictions as the
Committee may determine, including a requirement that the participant remain in
the employ of the Company or one of its subsidiaries for a set period of time,
or until retirement. Failure to abide by any applicable restriction will result
in forfeiture of the shares.

2.       U.S. TAX EFFECTS

         INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS

                  With regard to tax effects which may accrue to the optionee,
         counsel advises that if the optionee has continuously been an employee
         from the time an option has been granted until at least three months
         before it is exercised, under existing law no taxable income results to
         the optionee from the exercise of an incentive stock option at the time
         of exercise. However, the spread at exercise is an "adjustment" item
         for alternative minimum tax purposes.

                  Any gain realized on the sale or other disposition of stock
         acquired on exercise of an incentive stock option is considered as
         long-term capital gain for tax purposes if the stock has been held more
         than two years after the date the option was granted and more than one
         year after the date of exercise of the option. If the stock is disposed
         of within one year after exercise, the lesser of any gain on such
         disposition or the spread at exercise (i.e., the excess of the fair
         market value of the stock on the date of exercise over the option
         price) is treated as ordinary income, and any appreciation after the
         date of exercise is considered long-term or short-term capital gain to
         the optionee depending on the holding period prior to sale. However,
         the spread at exercise (even if greater than the gain on the
         disposition) is treated as ordinary income if the disposition is one on
         which a loss, if sustained, is not recognized--e.g., a gift, a "wash"
         sale or a sale to a related party. The amount of ordinary income
         recognized by the optionee is treated as a tax deductible expense to
         the Company. No other amount relative to an incentive stock option is a
         tax deductible expense to the Company.

         NONSTATUTORY STOCK OPTIONS

                  With regard to tax effects which may accrue to the optionee,
         counsel advises that under existing tax law gain taxable as ordinary
         income to the optionee is deemed to be realized at the date of exercise
         of the option, the gain on each share being the difference between the
         market price on the date of exercise and the option price. This amount
         is treated as a tax deductible expense to the Company at the time of
         the exercise of the option. Any appreciation in the value of the stock
         after the date of exercise is considered a long-term or short-term
         capital gain to the optionee depending on whether or not the stock was
         held for the appropriate holding period prior to sale.

         STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS

                  With regard to tax effects which may accrue to the recipient,
         counsel advises that "United States persons," as defined in the
         Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "I.R.C."), must

<PAGE>


          recognize ordinary income as of the date of exercise equal to the
          amount paid to the recipient, i.e., the difference between the grant
          price and the value of the shares on the date of exercise.

         SHARES AWARDED AS A PORTION OF REMUNERATION

                  With regard to tax effects which may accrue to the recipient,
         counsel advises that "United States persons" as defined in the Internal
         Revenue Code of 1986 (the "I.R.C."), must recognize ordinary income in
         the first taxable year in which the recipient's rights to the stock are
         transferable or are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture,
         whichever is applicable. Recipients who are "United States persons" may
         also elect to include the income in their tax returns for the taxable
         year in which they receive the shares by filing an election to do so
         with the appropriate office of the Internal Revenue Service within 30
         days of the date the shares are transferred to them.

                  The amount includable in income is the fair market value of
         the shares as of the day the shares are transferable or not subject to
         a substantial risk of forfeiture, whichever is applicable; if the
         recipient has elected to include the income in the year in which the
         shares are received, the amount of income includable is the fair market
         value of the shares at the time of transfer.

                  For non-United States persons, the time when income is
         realized, its measurement and its taxation, will depend on the laws of
         the particular countries in which the recipients are residents and/or
         citizens at the time of transfer or when the shares are first
         transferable and not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, as
         the case may be. "United States persons" who receive shares awarded as
         a portion of remuneration may also have tax consequences with respect
         to the receipt of shares or the expiration of restrictions or
         substantial risk of forfeiture on such shares under the laws of the
         particular country other than the United States of which such person is
         a resident or citizen.

         Notwithstanding the above advice received by the Company, it is each
individual recipient's responsibility to check with his or her personal tax
adviser as to the tax effects and proper handling of stock options, stock
appreciation rights and Common Stock acquired. The above advice relates
specifically to the U.S. consequences of stock options, stock appreciation
rights and Common Stock acquired, including the U.S. consequences to "United
States persons" whether or not resident in the U.S. In addition to U.S. tax
consequences, for all persons who are not U.S. residents, the time when income,
if any, is realized, the measurement of such income and its taxation will also
depend on the laws of the particular country other than the U.S. of which such
persons are resident and/or citizens at the time of grant or the time of
exercise, as the case may be.

         The Plan is not subject to the qualification requirements of Section
401(a) of the I.R.C.

3.       EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974

         The Plan is not subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"), as amended.

4.       INCORPORATION OF CERTAIN DOCUMENTS BY REFERENCE

         The following documents filed by the Company with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (File No. 1-434) pursuant to the 1934 Act are incorporated

      Common Stock and that any outstanding options may be suspended or
      terminated if you engage in actions that are significantly contrary to the

                    EMPLOYEE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND CONSENT FORM

I understand that I am eligible to receive a grant of stock options under The
Procter & Gamble 2001 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan").

Data Privacy

I hereby explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and
transfer, in electronic or other form, of my personal data as described in this
document by and among, as applicable, my employer ("Employer") and The Procter &
Gamble Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates ("P&G") for the exclusive
purpose of implementing, administering and managing my participation in the
Plan.

I understand that P&G and my Employer hold certain personal information about
me, including, but not limited to, my name, home address and telephone number,
date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number, salary,
nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in P&G,
details of all options or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded,
canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in my favor, for the
purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan ("Data"). I
understand that Data may be transferred to any third parties assisting in the
implementation, administration and management of the Plan, that these recipients
may be located in my country or elsewhere, and that the recipient's country may
have different data privacy laws and protections than my country. I understand
that I may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential
recipients of the Data by contacting my local human resources representative. I
authorize the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data,
in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering and
managing my participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such
Data as may be required to a broker or other third party with whom I may elect
to deposit any shares of stock acquired upon exercise of the option. I
understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement,
administer and manage my participation in the Plan. I understand that I may, at
any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and
processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or
withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing
my local human resources representative. I understand, however, that refusing or
withdrawing my consent may affect my ability to participate in the Plan. For
more information on the consequences of my refusal to consent or withdrawal of
consent, I understand that I may contact my local human resources
representative.

Nature of Grant

By completing this form and accepting the grant of the stock option evidenced
hereby, I acknowledge that: i) the Plan is established voluntarily by The
Procter & Gamble Company, it is discretionary in nature and it may be amended,
suspended or terminated at any time; ii) the grant of options under the Plan is
voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to
receive future grants of options, or benefits in lieu of options, even if
options have been granted repeatedly in the past; iii) all decisions with
respect to future grants of options, if any, will be at the sole discretion of
P&G; iv) my participation in the Plan is voluntary; v) the option is an
extraordinary item and not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for
any purposes including, but not limited to, calculating any termination,
severance, resignation, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses,
long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments; vi) in
the event that my employer is not P&G, the grant of options will not be
interpreted to form an employment relationship with P&G; and furthermore, the
grant of options will not be interpreted to form an employment contract with my
Employer; vii) the future value of the shares purchased under the Plan is
unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty, may increase or decrease in
value, even below the exercise price and, if the underlying shares do not
increase in value, the option will have no value; iix) my participation in the
Plan shall not create a right to further employment with my Employer and shall
not interfere with the ability of my Employer to terminate my employment
relationship at any time, with or without cause; ix) and no claim or entitlement
to compensation or damages arises from the termination of the option or the
diminution in value of the option or shares purchased and I irrevocably release
P&G and my Employer from any such claim that may arise.

Responsibility for Taxes

Regardless of any action P&G or my Employer takes with respect to any or all
income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other
tax-related withholding ("Tax-Related Items"), I acknowledge that the ultimate
liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains my responsibility and that
P&G and/or my Employer (1) make no representations or undertakings regarding the
treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the option
grant, including the grant, vesting or exercise of the option, the subsequent
sale of shares acquired pursuant to such exercise and the receipt of any
dividends; and (2) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any
aspect of the option to reduce or eliminate my liability for Tax-Related Items.

Prior to exercise of the option, I shall pay or make adequate arrangements
satisfactory to P&G and/or my Employer to satisfy all withholding and payment on
account obligations of P&G and/or my Employer. In this regard, I authorize P&G
and/or my Employer to withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items from my wages or
other cash compensation paid to me by P&G and/or my Employer or from proceeds of
the sale of the shares. Alternatively, or in addition, if permissible under
local law, P&G may (1) sell or arrange for the sale of shares that I acquire to
meet the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items, and/or (2) withhold in
shares, provided that P&G only withholds the amount of shares necessary to
satisfy the minimum withholding amount. Finally, I shall pay to P&G or my
Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that P&G or my Employer may be required
to withhold as a result of my participation in the Plan or my purchase of shares
that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. P&G may refuse to
honor the exercise and refuse to deliver the shares if I fail to comply with my
obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items as described in this
section.

                          THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY

          STATEMENT OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

         THE PROCTER & GAMBLE 2001 STOCK AND INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN

      The Restricted Stock Units awarded to you as set forth in the letter you
received from the Company (your "Award Letter"), and your ownership thereof, are
subject to the following terms and conditions.

1.    DEFINITIONS.

      For purposes of this Statement of Terms and Conditions for Restricted
Stock Units ("Terms and Conditions"), all capitalized terms not defined in these
Terms and Conditions will have the meanings described in The Procter & Gamble
2001 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan"), and the following terms
will have the following meanings.

      (a) "DATA" has the meaning described in Section 10;

      (b) "DISABILITY" means termination of employment under the permanent
      disability provision of any retirement plan of Procter & Gamble;

      (c) "DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS" has the meaning described in Section 4;

      (d) "FORFEITURE DATE" is the date identified as such in your Award Letter;

      (e) "FORFEITURE PERIOD" means the period from the Grant Date until the
      Forfeiture Date.

      (f) "GRANT DATE" means the date a Restricted Stock Unit was awarded to
      you, as identified in your Award Letter;

      (g) "ORIGINAL SETTLEMENT DATE" is the date identified as such in your
      Award Letter, as adjusted, if applicable, by Section 2;

      (h) "POST-FORFEITURE PERIOD" means the period from the Forfeiture Date
      until the Original Settlement Date;

      (i) "PROCTER & GAMBLE" means the Company and/or its Subsidiaries;

      (j) "RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT" means an unfunded, unsecured promise by the
      Company, in accordance with these Terms and Conditions and the provisions
      of the Plan, to issue to you one share of Common Stock on the Original
      Settlement Date.

2.    TRANSFER AND RESTRICTIONS.

      (a) Neither Restricted Stock Units nor your interest in them may be sold,
      exchanged, transferred, pledged, hypothecated, given or otherwise disposed
      of by you at any time, except by will or by the laws of descent and
      distribution. Any attempted transfer of a Restricted Stock Unit, whether
      voluntary or involuntary on your part, will result in the immediate
      forfeiture to the Company, and cancellation, of the Restricted Stock Unit
      (including all rights to receive Dividend Equivalents).

<PAGE>

      (b) During the Forfeiture Period, your Restricted Stock Units (including
      all rights to receive Dividend Equivalents) will be forfeited and
      cancelled if you leave your employment with Procter & Gamble for any
      reason, except due to: (i) your Disability; or (ii) in certain
      circumstances, your Special Separation. In the event of your Disability
      during the Forfeiture Period, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the
      Company, your Original Settlement Date will automatically and immediately
      become, without any further action by you or the Company, the date of your
      Disability. In the event of your Special Separation during the Forfeiture
      Period, your Restricted Stock Units will be forfeited and cancelled unless
      otherwise agreed to in writing by the Company.

      (c) During the Post-Forfeiture Period, if you leave your employment with
      Procter & Gamble for any reason other than: (i) Disability; (ii) Special
      Separation; or (iii) retirement in accordance with the provisions of any
      appropriate retirement plan of Procter & Gamble, your Original Settlement
      Date will automatically and immediately become, without any further action
      by you or the Company, the date of your termination of employment. In the
      event of your Disability or Special Separation during the Post-Forfeiture
      Period, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Company, your
      Original Settlement Date will automatically and immediately become,
      without any further action by you or the Company, the date of your
      Disability or Special Separation, as applicable. In the event of your
      retirement in accordance with the provisions of any appropriate retirement
      plan of Procter & Gamble during the Post-Forfeiture Period, you will
      retain your Restricted Stock Units subject to the Plan and these Terms and
      Conditions.

      (d) Upon your death or the occurrence of a Change in Control at any time
      while you hold Restricted Stock Units and/or Dividend Equivalents, your
      Original Settlement Date will automatically and immediately become,
      without any further action by you or the Company, the date of your death
      or of the Change in Control, as applicable.

      (e) From time to time, the Company and/or the Committee may establish
      procedures with which you must comply in order to accept an award of
      Restricted Stock Units, or to settle your Restricted Stock Units,
      including requiring you to do so by means of electronic signature, or
      charging you an administrative fee for doing so.

      (f) Once your Restricted Stock Units have been settled by delivery to you
      of an equivalent number of shares of Common Stock, the Restricted Stock
      Units will have no further value, force or effect and you will cease to
      receive Dividend Equivalents associated with the Restricted Stock Units.

3.    CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-COMPETITION

      (a) In order to better protect the goodwill of Procter & Gamble and to
      prevent the disclosure of Procter & Gamble's trade secrets and
      confidential information, and thereby help ensure the long-term success of
      Procter & Gamble's business, in consideration of your being awarded
      Restricted Stock Units, you (without prior written consent of Procter &
      Gamble), will not engage in any activity or provide any services, whether
      as a director, manager, supervisor, employee, advisor, consultant or
      otherwise, for a period of three (3) years following the date your
      employment with Procter & Gamble is terminated (except for terminations
      resulting from Retirement or Special Separation), in connection with the
      manufacture, development, advertising, promotion, or sale of any product
      which is the same as or similar to or competitive with any products of
      Procter & Gamble (including both existing products as well as products
      known to you, as a consequence of your employment with Procter & Gamble,
      to be in development):

            (i) with respect to which your work has been directly concerned at
            any time during the two (2) years preceding the termination of your
            employment with Procter & Gamble; or

<PAGE>

            (ii) with respect to which, during the two (2) years preceding the
            termination of your employment with Procter & Gamble, you, as a
            consequence of your job performance and duties, acquired knowledge
            of trade secrets or other confidential information of Procter &
            Gamble.

      For purposes of this Section 3(a), it will be conclusively presumed that
      you have knowledge of information you were directly exposed to through
      actual receipt or review of memoranda or documents containing such
      information, or through attendance at meetings at which such information
      was discussed or disclosed.

      (b) The provisions of Section 3(a) are not in lieu of, but are in addition
      to your continuing obligation (which you acknowledge by accepting an award
      of Restricted Stock Units) to not use or disclose Procter & Gamble's trade
      secrets or confidential information known to you until any particular
      trade secret or confidential information becomes generally known (through
      no fault of yours). As used in this Section 3(b), "generally known" means
      known throughout the domestic United States industry or, if you have job
      responsibilities partially or entirely outside of the United States, the
      appropriate domestic United States and/or appropriate foreign country or
      countries' industry(ies). Information regarding products in development,
      in test marketing, or being marketed or promoted in a discrete geographic
      region, which information Procter & Gamble is considering for broader use,
      will not be deemed to be "generally known" until such broader use is
      actually commercially implemented.

      (c) By accepting an award of Restricted Stock Units, you agree that, if
      you were, without authority, to use or disclose Procter & Gamble's trade
      secrets or confidential information or threaten to do so, Procter & Gamble
      would be entitled to injunctive and other appropriate relief to prevent
      you from doing so. You further agree that the harm caused to Procter &
      Gamble by the breach or anticipated breach of this Section 3(c) is, by its
      nature, irreparable because, among other things, it is not readily
      susceptible of proof as to the monetary harm that would ensue. You agree
      that any interim or final equitable relief entered by a court of competent
      jurisdiction will, at the request of Procter & Gamble, be entered on
      consent and enforced by any court having jurisdiction over you, without
      prejudice to any rights you or Procter & Gamble may have to appeal from
      the proceedings which resulted in any grant of such relief.

      (d) If any of the provisions contained in Sections 3(a) through (c) are
      for any reason, whether by application of existing law or law which may
      develop after your acceptance of an award of Restricted Stock Units,
      determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be overly broad as to
      scope of activity, duration, or territory, then by accepting an award of
      Restricted Stock Units you agree to join Procter & Gamble in requesting
      such court to construe such provision by limiting or reducing it so as to
      be enforceable to the extent compatible with then-applicable law. If any
      one or more of the provisions contained in Section 3(a) through (c) are
      determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or
      unenforceable, then the remainder of the provisions will remain in full
      force and effect and will not be affected, impaired or invalidated in any
      way.

4.    DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS.

      As a holder of Restricted Stock Units, during the period from the Grant
Date until the Original Settlement Date, each time a cash dividend or other cash
distribution is paid with respect to Common Stock, you will receive additional
Restricted Stock Units ("Dividend Equivalents"). The number of such additional
Restricted Stock Units will be determined as follows: multiply the number of
Restricted Stock Units currently held by the per share amount of the cash
dividend or other cash distribution on the Common Stock, and then divide the
result by the price of the Common Stock on the date of the dividend or
distribution. These Dividend Equivalent Restricted Stock Units will be subject
to the same terms and conditions as the original Restricted Stock Units that
gave rise to them, including forfeiture and settlement terms, except that if
there is a fractional number of Dividend Equivalent Restricted Stock Units on
the

<PAGE>

date they are to be settled, you will receive one share of Common Stock for the
fractional Dividend Equivalent Restricted Stock Units.

5.    VOTING AND OTHER SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS.

      A Restricted Stock Unit is not a share of Common Stock, and thus you are
not entitled to any voting, dividend or other rights as a shareholder of the
Company with respect to the Restricted Stock Units you hold.

6.    ADJUSTMENTS IN CASE OF STOCK DIVIDENDS, STOCK SPLITS, ETC.

      In the event of a future reorganization, recapitalization, stock split,
stock dividend, combination of shares, merger, consolidation, rights offering,
share exchange, reclassification, distribution, spin-off, or other change
affecting the corporate structure, capitalization or Common Stock, the number of
Restricted Stock Units you hold will be adjusted appropriately and equitably to
prevent dilution or enlargement of your rights.

7.    TAX WITHHOLDING.

      To the extent Procter & Gamble is required to withhold federal, state,
local or foreign taxes in connection with your Restricted Stock Units or
Dividend Equivalents, the Committee may require you to make such arrangements as
Procter & Gamble may deem appropriate for the payment of such taxes required to
be withheld, including without limitation, relinquishment of some of the shares
of Common Stock that would otherwise be given to you. However, regardless of any
action taken by Procter & Gamble with respect to any income tax, social
insurance, payroll tax, or other tax, by accepting a Restricted Stock Unit or
Dividend Equivalent, you acknowledge that the ultimate liability for any such
tax owed by you is and remains your responsibility, and that Procter & Gamble
makes no representations about the tax treatment of your Restricted Stock Units
or Dividend Equivalents, and does not commit to structure any aspect of the
Restricted Stock Units or Dividend Equivalents to reduce or eliminate your tax
liability.

8.    SUSPENSION PERIODS AND TERMINATION.

      The Company reserves the right from time to time to temporarily suspend
your right to settle your Restricted Stock Units for shares of Common Stock
where such suspension is deemed by the Company as necessary or appropriate.

9.    PROCTER & GAMBLE RIGHT TO TERMINATE EMPLOYMENT AND OTHER REMEDIES.

      (a) Nothing in these Terms and Conditions, or the fact that you have been
      awarded Restricted Stock Units, affects in any way the right or power of
      Procter & Gamble to terminate your employment at any time for any reason,
      with or without cause, or precludes Procter & Gamble from taking any
      action or enforcing any remedy available to it with respect to any action
      or conduct on your part. Without limiting the previous sentence, the
      Committee may, for example, suspend or terminate any outstanding
      Restricted Stock Units for actions taken by you prior to the termination
      of your employment if the Committee determines that you have acted
      significantly contrary to the best interests of Procter & Gamble.

      (b) By accepting a Restricted Stock Unit, you acknowledge that: (i) the
      Plan is established voluntarily by The Procter & Gamble Company, is
      discretionary in nature, and may be amended, suspended or terminated at
      any time; (ii) the award of Restricted Stock Units is voluntary and
      occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive
      future awards of Restricted Stock Units, or benefits in lieu of Restricted
      Stock Units, even if Restricted Stock Units have been awarded repeatedly
      in the past; (iii) all decisions with respect to future Restricted Stock
      Unit awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company; (iv)
      your participation in

<PAGE>

      the Plan is voluntary; (v) Restricted Stock Units are an extraordinary
      item and not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any
      purpose, including without limitation calculating any termination,
      severance, resignation, redundancy, or end-of-service payments, bonuses,
      long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments;
      (vi) in the event that your employer is not the Company, the award of
      Restricted Stock Units will not be interpreted to form an employment
      relationship with the Company; and, furthermore, the award of Restricted
      Stock Units will not be interpreted to form an employment contract with
      any Procter & Gamble entity; (vii) the future value of Common Stock is
      unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty; and (viii) no claim or
      entitlement to compensation or damages arises from termination or
      forfeiture of Restricted Stock Units, or diminution in value of Restricted
      Stock Units or Common Stock received in settlement thereof, and you
      irrevocably release Procter & Gamble from any such claim that may arise.

10.   DATA PRIVACY.

      By accepting a Restricted Stock Unit, you explicitly and unambiguously
consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of
your personal data as described in this document by and among, as applicable,
any Procter & Gamble entity or third party for the purpose of implementing,
administering and managing your participation in the Plan. You understand that
Procter & Gamble holds certain personal information about you, including without
limitation your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social
insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title,
any shares of stock or directorships held in a Procter & Gamble entity, details
of all options, Restricted Stock Units, or any other entitlement to shares of
stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your
favor, for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan
("Data"). You understand that Data may be transferred to any third parties
assisting in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan, that
these recipients may be located in your country or elsewhere, and that the
recipient's country may have different data privacy laws and protections than
your country. You understand that you may request a list with the names and
addresses of any potential recipients of Data by contacting your local human
resources representative. You authorize the recipients to receive, possess, use,
retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of
implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan,
including any requisite transfer of such Data to any broker or other third party
with whom you may elect to deposit any shares of Common Stock in connection with
the settlement of your Restricted Stock Units. You understand that Data will be
held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your
participation in the plan. You understand that you may, at any time, view Data,
request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require
any necessary amendments to Data, or refuse or withdraw the consents contained
in this paragraph, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local
human resources representative. You understand, however, that refusing or
withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the Plan. For
more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of
consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources
representative.

      Date;

      (j) "PROCTER & GAMBLE" means the Company and/or its Subsidiaries;

      (k) "RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT" means an unfunded, unsecured promise by the
      Company, in accordance with these Terms and Conditions and the provisions
      of the Plan, to issue to you one share of Common Stock on the later of the
      Original Settlement Date or the Agreed Settlement Date.

2.    TRANSFER AND RESTRICTIONS.

      (a) Neither Restricted Stock Units nor your interest in them may be sold,
      exchanged, transferred, pledged, hypothecated, given or otherwise disposed
      of by you at any time, except by will or by the laws of descent and
      distribution. Any attempted transfer of a Restricted Stock Unit,

<PAGE>

      whether voluntary or involuntary on your part, will result in the
      immediate forfeiture to the Company, and cancellation, of the Restricted
      Stock Unit (including all rights to Dividend Equivalents).

      (b) During the Forfeiture Period, your Restricted Stock Units (including
      all rights to receive Dividend Equivalents) will be forfeited and
      cancelled if you leave your employment with Procter & Gamble for any
      reason, except due to: (i) your Disability; (ii) your retirement in
      accordance with the provisions of any appropriate retirement plan of
      Procter & Gamble; or (iii) in certain circumstances, your Special
      Separation. In the event of your Disability during the Forfeiture Period,
      unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Company, your Original
      Settlement Date will automatically and immediately become, without any
      further action by you or the Company, the date of your Disability. In the
      event of your retirement in accordance with the provisions of any
      appropriate retirement plan of Procter & Gamble during the Forfeiture
      Period, you will retain your Restricted Stock Units subject to the Plan
      and these Terms and Conditions. In the event of your Special Separation
      during the Forfeiture Period, your Restricted Stock Units will be
      forfeited and cancelled unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the
      Company.

      (c) At any time at least one calendar year prior to the Original
      Settlement Date, you and the Company may agree to postpone the date on
      which you are entitled to receive one share of Common Stock for each
      Restricted Stock Unit you hold until January 15th of any later year (the
      "Agreed Settlement Date"). During the Post-Forfeiture Period, if you leave
      your employment with Procter & Gamble for any reason other than: (i)
      Disability; (ii) Special Separation; or (iii) retirement in accordance
      with the provisions of any appropriate retirement plan of Procter &
      Gamble, your Original Settlement Date or Agreed Settlement Date, as
      applicable, will automatically and immediately become, without any further
      action by you or the Company, the date of your termination of employment.
      In the event of your Disability or Special Separation during the
      Post-Forfeiture period, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the
      Company, your Original Settlement Date or Agreed Settlement Date, as
      applicable, will automatically and immediately become, without any further
      action by you or the Company, the date of your Disability or Special
      Separation, as applicable. In the event of your retirement in accordance
      with the provisions of any appropriate retirement plan of Procter & Gamble
      during the Post-Forfeiture Period, you will retain your Restricted Stock
      Units subject to the Plan and these Terms and Conditions.

      (d) Upon your death or the occurrence of a Change in Control at any time
      while you hold Restricted Stock Units and/or Dividend Equivalents, your
      Original Settlement Date or Agreed Settlement Date, as applicable, will
      automatically and immediately become, without any further action by you or
      the Company, the date of your death or of the Change in Control, as
      applicable.

      (e) From time to time, the Company and/or the Committee may establish
      procedures with which you must comply in order to accept an award of
      Restricted Stock Units, to agree to an Agreed Settlement Date, or to
      settle your Restricted Stock Units, including requiring you to do so by
      means of electronic signature, or charging you an administrative fee for
      doing so.

      (f) Once your Restricted Stock Units have been settled by delivery to you
      of an equivalent number of shares of Common Stock, the Restricted Stock
      Units will have no further value, force or effect and you will cease to
      receive Dividend Equivalents associated with the Restricted Stock Units.

3.    CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-COMPETITION

      (a) In order to better protect the goodwill of Procter & Gamble and to
      prevent the disclosure of Procter & Gamble's trade secrets and
      confidential information, and thereby help ensure the long-term success of
      Procter & Gamble's business, in consideration of your being awarded
      Restricted Stock Units, you (without prior written consent of Procter &
      Gamble), will not engage

<PAGE>

      in any activity or provide any services, whether as a director, manager,
      supervisor, employee, advisor, consultant or otherwise, for a period of
      three (3) years following the date your employment with Procter & Gamble
      is terminated (except for terminations resulting from Retirement or
      Special Separation), in connection with the manufacture, development,
      advertising, promotion, or sale of any product which is the same as or
      similar to or competitive with any products of Procter & Gamble (including
      both existing products as well as products known to you, as a consequence
      of your employment with Procter & Gamble, to be in development):

            (i) with respect to which your work has been directly concerned at
            any time during the two (2) years preceding the termination of your
            employment with Procter & Gamble; or

            (ii) with respect to which, during the two (2) years preceding the
            termination of your employment with Procter & Gamble, you, as a
            consequence of your job performance and duties, acquired knowledge
            of trade secrets or other confidential information of Procter &
            Gamble.

      For purposes of this Section 3(a), it will be conclusively presumed that
      you have knowledge of information you were directly exposed to through
      actual receipt or review of memoranda or documents containing such
      information, or through attendance at meetings at which such information
      was discussed or disclosed.

      (b) The provisions of Section 3(a) are not in lieu of, but are in addition
      to your continuing obligation (which you acknowledge by accepting an award
      of Restricted Stock Units) to not use or disclose Procter & Gamble's trade
      secrets or confidential information known to you until any particular
      trade secret or confidential information becomes generally known (through
      no fault of yours). As used in this Section 3(b), "generally known" means
      known throughout the domestic United States industry or, if you have job
      responsibilities partially or entirely outside of the United States, the
      appropriate domestic United States and/or appropriate foreign country or
      countries' industry(ies). Information regarding products in development,
      in test marketing, or being marketed or promoted in a discrete geographic
      region, which information Procter & Gamble is considering for broader use,
      will not be deemed to be "generally known" until such broader use is
      actually commercially implemented.

      (c) By accepting an award of Restricted Stock Units, you agree that, if
      you were, without authority, to use or disclose Procter & Gamble's trade
      secrets or confidential information or threaten to do so, Procter & Gamble
      would be entitled to injunctive and other appropriate relief to prevent
      you from doing so. You further agree that the harm caused to Procter &
      Gamble by the breach or anticipated breach of this Section 3(c) is, by its
      nature, irreparable because, among other things, it is not readily
      susceptible of proof as to the monetary harm that would ensue. You agree
      that any interim or final equitable relief entered by a court of competent
      jurisdiction will, at the request of Procter & Gamble, be entered on
      consent and enforced by any court having jurisdiction over you, without
      prejudice to any rights you or Procter & Gamble may have to appeal from
      the proceedings which resulted in any grant of such relief.

      (d) If any of the provisions contained in Sections 3(a) through (c) are
      for any reason, whether by application of existing law or law which may
      develop after your acceptance of an award of Restricted Stock Units,
      determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be overly broad as to
      scope of activity, duration, or territory, then by accepting an award of
      Restricted Stock Units you agree to join Procter & Gamble in requesting
      such court to construe such provision by limiting or reducing it so as to
      be enforceable to the extent compatible with then-applicable law. If any
      one or more of the provisions contained in Section 3(a) through (c) are
      determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or
      unenforceable, then the remainder of the provisions will remain in full
      force and effect and will not be affected, impaired or invalidated in any
      way.

<PAGE>

4.    DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS.

      As a holder of Restricted Stock Units, during the period from the Grant
Date until the Original Settlement Date or the Agreed Settlement Date, whichever
is later, each time a cash dividend or other cash distribution is paid with
respect to Common Stock, you will receive additional Restricted Stock Units
("Dividend Equivalents"). The number of such additional Restricted Stock Units
will be determined as follows: multiply the number of Restricted Stock Units
currently held by the per share amount of the cash dividend or other cash
distribution on the Common Stock, and then divide the result by the price of the
Common Stock on the date of the dividend or distribution. These Dividend
Equivalent Restricted Stock Units will be subject to the same terms and
conditions as the original Restricted Stock Units that gave rise to them,
including forfeiture and settlement terms, except that if there is a fractional
number of Dividend Equivalent Restricted Stock Units on the date they are to be
settled, you will receive one share of Common Stock for the fractional Dividend
Equivalent Restricted Stock Units.

5.    VOTING AND OTHER SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS.

      A Restricted Stock Unit is not a share of Common Stock, and thus you are
not entitled to any voting, dividend or other rights as a shareholder of the
Company with respect to the Restricted Stock Units you hold.

6.    ADJUSTMENTS IN CASE OF STOCK DIVIDENDS, STOCK SPLITS, ETC.

      In the event of a future reorganization, recapitalization, stock split,
stock dividend, combination of shares, merger, consolidation, rights offering,
share exchange, reclassification, distribution, spin-off, or other change
affecting the corporate structure, capitalization or Common Stock, the number of
Restricted Stock Units you hold will be adjusted appropriately and equitably to
prevent dilution or enlargement of your rights.

7.    TAX WITHHOLDING.

      To the extent Procter & Gamble is required to withhold federal, state,
local or foreign taxes in connection with your Restricted Stock Units or
Dividend Equivalents, the Committee may require you to make such arrangements as
Procter & Gamble may deem appropriate for the payment of such taxes required to
be withheld, including without limitation, relinquishment of some of the shares
of Common Stock that would otherwise be given to you. However, regardless of any
action taken by Procter & Gamble with respect to any income tax, social
insurance, payroll tax, or other tax, by accepting a Restricted Stock Unit or
Dividend Equivalent, you acknowledge that the ultimate liability for any such
tax owed by you is and remains your responsibility, and that Procter & Gamble
makes no representations about the tax treatment of your Restricted Stock Units
or Dividend Equivalents, and does not commit to structure any aspect of the
Restricted Stock Units or Dividend Equivalents to reduce or eliminate your tax
liability.

8.    SUSPENSION PERIODS AND TERMINATION.

      The Company reserves the right from time to time to temporarily suspend
your right to settle your Restricted Stock Units for shares of Common Stock
where such suspension is deemed by the Company as necessary or appropriate.

9.    PROCTER & GAMBLE RIGHT TO TERMINATE EMPLOYMENT AND OTHER REMEDIES.

      (a) Nothing in these Terms and Conditions, or the fact that you have been
      awarded Restricted Stock Units, affects in any way the right or power of
      Procter & Gamble to terminate your employment at any time for any reason,
      with or without cause, or precludes Procter & Gamble from taking any
      action or enforcing any remedy available to it with respect to any action
      or conduct on your part. Without limiting the previous sentence, the
      Committee may, for

<PAGE>

      example, suspend or terminate any outstanding Restricted Stock Units for
      actions taken by you prior to the termination of your employment if the
      Committee determines that you have acted significantly contrary to the
      best interests of Procter & Gamble.

      (b) By accepting a Restricted Stock Unit, you acknowledge that: (i) the
      Plan is established voluntarily by The Procter & Gamble Company, is
      discretionary in nature, and may be amended, suspended or terminated at
      any time; (ii) the award of Restricted Stock Units is voluntary and
      occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive
      future awards of Restricted Stock Units, or benefits in lieu of Restricted
      Stock Units, even if Restricted Stock Units have been awarded repeatedly
      in the past; (iii) all decisions with respect to future Restricted Stock
      Unit awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company; (iv)
      your participation in the Plan is voluntary; (v) Restricted Stock Units
      are an extraordinary item and not part of normal or expected compensation
      or salary for any purpose, including without limitation calculating any
      termination, severance, resignation, redundancy, or end-of-service
      payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or
      similar payments; (vi) in the event that your employer is not the Company,
      the award of Restricted Stock Units will not be interpreted to form an
      employment relationship with the Company; and, furthermore, the award of
      Restricted Stock Units will not be interpreted to form an employment
      contract with any Procter & Gamble entity; (vii) the future value of
      Common Stock is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty; and (viii)
      no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages arises from termination
      or forfeiture of Restricted Stock Units, or diminution in value of
      Restricted Stock Units or Common Stock received in settlement thereof, and
      you irrevocably release Procter & Gamble from any such claim that may
      arise.

10.   DATA PRIVACY.

      By accepting a Restricted Stock Unit, you explicitly and unambiguously
consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of
your personal data as described in this document by and among, as applicable,
any Procter & Gamble entity or third party for the purpose of implementing,
administering and managing your participation in the Plan. You understand that
Procter & Gamble holds certain personal information about you, including without
limitation your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social
insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title,
any shares of stock or directorships held in a Procter & Gamble entity, details
of all options, Restricted Stock Units, or any other entitlement to shares of
stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your
favor, for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan
("Data"). You understand that Data may be transferred to any third parties
assisting in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan, that
these recipients may be located in your country or elsewhere, and that the
recipient's country may have different data privacy laws and protections than
your country. You understand that you may request a list with the names and
addresses of any potential recipients of Data by contacting your local human
resources representative. You authorize the recipients to receive, possess, use,
retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of
implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan,
including any requisite transfer of such Data to any broker or other third party
with whom you may elect to deposit any shares of Common Stock in connection with
the settlement of your Restricted Stock Units. You understand that Data will be
held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your
participation in the plan. You understand that you may, at any time, view Data,
request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require
any necessary amendments to Data, or refuse or withdraw the consents contained
in this paragraph, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local
human resources representative. You understand, however, that refusing or
withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the Plan. For
more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of
consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources
representative.

                          THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY

          STATEMENT OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

         THE PROCTER & GAMBLE 2001 STOCK AND INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN

      The Restricted Stock Units awarded to you as set forth in the letter you
received from the Company (your "Award Letter"), and your ownership thereof, are
subject to the following terms and conditions.

1.    DEFINITIONS.

      For purposes of this Statement of Terms and Conditions for Restricted

      (c) "DISABILITY" means termination of employment under the permanent
      disability provision of any retirement plan of Procter & Gamble;

      (d) "DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS" has the meaning described in Section 4;

      (e) "GRANT DATE" means the date a Restricted Stock Unit was awarded to

      Award Letter, as adjusted, if applicable, by Section 2;

      (g) "PROCTER & GAMBLE" means the Company and/or its Subsidiaries;

      (h) "RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT" means an unfunded, unsecured promise by the
      Company, in accordance with these Terms and Conditions and the provisions
      of the Plan, to issue to you one share of Common Stock on the later of the
      Original Settlement Date or the Agreed Settlement Date.

      (i) "SETTLEMENT PERIOD" means the period from the Grant Date until the
      later of the Original Settlement Date or the Agreed Settlement Date.

2.    TRANSFER AND RESTRICTIONS.

      (a) Neither Restricted Stock Units nor your interest in them may be sold,
      exchanged, transferred, pledged, hypothecated, given or otherwise disposed
      of by you at any time, except by will or by the laws of descent and
      distribution. Any attempted transfer of a Restricted Stock Unit, whether
      voluntary or involuntary on your part, will result in the immediate
      forfeiture to the Company, and cancellation, of the Restricted Stock Unit
      (including all rights to Dividend Equivalents).

<PAGE>

      (b) At any time at least one calendar year prior to the Original
      Settlement Date, you and the Company may agree to postpone the date on
      which you are entitled to receive one share of Common Stock for each
      Restricted Stock Unit you hold until January 15th of any later year (the
      "Agreed Settlement Date"). During the Settlement Period, if you leave your
      employment with Procter & Gamble for any reason other than: (i)
      Disability; (ii) Special Separation; or (iii) retirement in accordance
      with the provisions of any appropriate retirement plan of Procter &
      Gamble, your Original Settlement Date or Agreed Settlement Date, as
      applicable, will automatically and immediately become, without any further
      action by you or the Company, the date of your termination of employment.
      In the event of your Disability or Special Separation during the
      Settlement Period, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Company,
      your Original Settlement Date or Agreed Settlement Date, as applicable,
      will automatically and immediately become, without any further action by
      you or the Company, the date of your Disability or Special Separation, as
      applicable. In the event of your retirement in accordance with the
      provisions of any appropriate retirement plan of Procter & Gamble during
      the Settlement Period, you will retain your Restricted Stock Units subject
      to the Plan and these Terms and Conditions.

      (c) Upon your death or the occurrence of a Change in Control at any time
      while you hold Restricted Stock Units and/or Dividend Equivalents, your
      Original Settlement Date or Agreed Settlement Date, as applicable, will
      automatically and immediately become, without any further action by you or
      the Company, the date of your death or of the Change in Control, as
      applicable.

      (d) From time to time, the Company and/or the Committee may establish
      procedures with which you must comply in order to accept an award of
      Restricted Stock Units, to agree to an Agreed Settlement Date, or to
      settle your Restricted Stock Units, including requiring you to do so by
      means of electronic signature, or charging you an administrative fee for
      doing so.

      (e) Once your Restricted Stock Units have been settled by delivery to you
      of an equivalent number of shares of Common Stock, the Restricted Stock
      Units will have no further value, force or effect and you will cease to
      receive Dividend Equivalents associated with the Restricted Stock Units.

3.    CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-COMPETITION

      (a) In order to better protect the goodwill of Procter & Gamble and to
      prevent the disclosure of Procter & Gamble's trade secrets and
      confidential information, and thereby help ensure the long-term success of
      Procter & Gamble's business, in consideration of your being awarded
      Restricted Stock Units, you (without prior written consent of Procter &
      Gamble), will not engage in any activity or provide any services, whether
      as a director, manager, supervisor, employee, advisor, consultant or
      otherwise, for a period of three (3) years following the date your
      employment with Procter & Gamble is terminated (except for terminations
      resulting from Retirement or Special Separation), in connection with the
      manufacture, development, advertising, promotion, or sale of any product
      which is the same as or similar to or competitive with any products of
      Procter & Gamble (including both existing products as well as products
      known to you, as a consequence of your employment with Procter & Gamble,
      to be in development):

            (i) with respect to which your work has been directly concerned at
            any time during the two (2) years preceding the termination of your
            employment with Procter & Gamble; or

            (ii) with respect to which, during the two (2) years preceding the
            termination of your employment with Procter & Gamble, you, as a
            consequence of your job performance and duties, acquired knowledge
            of trade secrets or other confidential information of Procter &
            Gamble.

<PAGE>

      For purposes of this Section 3(a), it will be conclusively presumed that
      you have knowledge of information you were directly exposed to through
      actual receipt or review of memoranda or documents containing such
      information, or through attendance at meetings at which such information
      was discussed or disclosed.

      (b) The provisions of Section 3(a) are not in lieu of, but are in addition
      to your continuing obligation (which you acknowledge by accepting an award
      of Restricted Stock Units) to not use or disclose Procter & Gamble's trade
      secrets or confidential information known to you until any particular
      trade secret or confidential information becomes generally known (through
      no fault of yours). As used in this Section 3(b), "generally known" means
      known throughout the domestic United States industry or, if you have job
      responsibilities partially or entirely outside of the United States, the
      appropriate domestic United States and/or appropriate foreign country or
      countries' industry(ies). Information regarding products in development,
      in test marketing, or being marketed or promoted in a discrete geographic
      region, which information Procter & Gamble is considering for broader use,
      will not be deemed to be "generally known" until such broader use is
      actually commercially implemented.

      (c) By accepting an award of Restricted Stock Units, you agree that, if
      you were, without authority, to use or disclose Procter & Gamble's trade
      secrets or confidential information or threaten to do so, Procter & Gamble
      would be entitled to injunctive and other appropriate relief to prevent
      you from doing so. You further agree that the harm caused to Procter &
      Gamble by the breach or anticipated breach of this Section 3(c) is, by its
      nature, irreparable because, among other things, it is not readily
      susceptible of proof as to the monetary harm that would ensue. You agree
      that any interim or final equitable relief entered by a court of competent
      jurisdiction will, at the request of Procter & Gamble, be entered on
      consent and enforced by any court having jurisdiction over you, without
      prejudice to any rights you or Procter & Gamble may have to appeal from
      the proceedings which resulted in any grant of such relief.

      (d) If any of the provisions contained in Sections 3(a) through (c) are
      for any reason, whether by application of existing law or law which may
      develop after your acceptance of an award of Restricted Stock Units,
      determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be overly broad as to
      scope of activity, duration, or territory, then by accepting an award of
      Restricted Stock Units you agree to join Procter & Gamble in requesting
      such court to construe such provision by limiting or reducing it so as to
      be enforceable to the extent compatible with then-applicable law. If any
      one or more of the provisions contained in Section 3(a) through (c) are
      determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or
      unenforceable, then the remainder of the provisions will remain in full
      force and effect and will not be affected, impaired or invalidated in any
      way.

4.    DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS.

      As a holder of Restricted Stock Units, during the period from the Grant
Date until the Original Settlement Date or the Agreed Settlement Date, whichever
is later, each time a cash dividend or other cash distribution is paid with
respect to Common Stock, you will receive additional Restricted Stock Units
("Dividend Equivalents"). The number of such additional Restricted Stock Units
will be determined as follows: multiply the number of Restricted Stock Units
currently held by the per share amount of the cash dividend or other cash
distribution on the Common Stock, and then divide the result by the price of the
Common Stock on the date of the dividend or distribution. These Dividend
Equivalent Restricted Stock Units will be subject to the same terms and
conditions as the original Restricted Stock Units that gave rise to them,
including forfeiture and settlement terms, except that if there is a fractional
number of Dividend Equivalent Restricted Stock Units on the date they are to be
settled, you will receive one share of Common Stock for the fractional Dividend
Equivalent Restricted Stock Units.

<PAGE>

5.    VOTING AND OTHER SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS.

      A Restricted Stock Unit is not a share of Common Stock, and thus you are
not entitled to any voting, dividend or other rights as a shareholder of the
Company with respect to the Restricted Stock Units you hold.

6.    ADJUSTMENTS IN CASE OF STOCK DIVIDENDS, STOCK SPLITS, ETC.

      In the event of a future reorganization, recapitalization, stock split,
stock dividend, combination of shares, merger, consolidation, rights offering,
share exchange, reclassification, distribution, spin-off, or other change
affecting the corporate structure, capitalization or Common Stock, the number of
Restricted Stock Units you hold will be adjusted appropriately and equitably to
prevent dilution or enlargement of your rights.

7.    TAX WITHHOLDING.

      To the extent Procter & Gamble is required to withhold federal, state,
local or foreign taxes in connection with your Restricted Stock Units or
Dividend Equivalents, the Committee may require you to make such arrangements as
Procter & Gamble may deem appropriate for the payment of such taxes required to
be withheld, including without limitation, relinquishment of some of the shares
of Common Stock that would otherwise be given to you. However, regardless of any
action taken by Procter & Gamble with respect to any income tax, social
insurance, payroll tax, or other tax, by accepting a Restricted Stock Unit or
Dividend Equivalent, you acknowledge that the ultimate liability for any such
tax owed by you is and remains your responsibility, and that Procter & Gamble
makes no representations about the tax treatment of your Restricted Stock Units
or Dividend Equivalents, and does not commit to structure any aspect of the
Restricted Stock Units or Dividend Equivalents to reduce or eliminate your tax
liability.

8.    SUSPENSION PERIODS AND TERMINATION.

      The Company reserves the right from time to time to temporarily suspend
your right to settle your Restricted Stock Units for shares of Common Stock
where such suspension is deemed by the Company as necessary or appropriate.

9.    PROCTER & GAMBLE RIGHT TO TERMINATE EMPLOYMENT AND OTHER REMEDIES.

      (a) Nothing in these Terms and Conditions, or the fact that you have been
      awarded Restricted Stock Units, affects in any way the right or power of
      Procter & Gamble to terminate your employment at any time for any reason,
      with or without cause, or precludes Procter & Gamble from taking any
      action or enforcing any remedy available to it with respect to any action
      or conduct on your part. Without limiting the previous sentence, the
      Committee may, for example, suspend or terminate any outstanding
      Restricted Stock Units for actions taken by you prior to the termination
      of your employment if the Committee determines that you have acted
      significantly contrary to the best interests of Procter & Gamble.

      (b) By accepting a Restricted Stock Unit, you acknowledge that: (i) the
      Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, is discretionary in
      nature, and may be amended, suspended or terminated at any time; (ii) the
      award of Restricted Stock Units is voluntary and occasional and does not
      create any contractual or other right to receive future awards of
      Restricted Stock Units, or benefits in lieu of Restricted Stock Units,
      even if Restricted Stock Units have been awarded repeatedly in the past;
      (iii) all decisions with respect to future Restricted Stock Unit awards,
      if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company; (iv) your
      participation in the Plan is voluntary; (v) Restricted Stock Units are an
      extraordinary item and not part of normal or expected compensation or
      salary for any purpose, including without limitation calculating any
      termination, severance, resignation, redundancy, or end-of-service
      payments, bonuses, long-service awards,

<PAGE>

      pension or retirement benefits or similar payments; (vi) in the event that
      your employer is not the Company, the award of Restricted Stock Units will
      not be interpreted to form an employment relationship with the Company;
      and, furthermore, the award of Restricted Stock Units will not be
      interpreted to form an employment contract with any Procter & Gamble
      entity; (vii) the future value of Common Stock is unknown and cannot be
      predicted with certainty; and (viii) no claim or entitlement to
      compensation or damages arises from termination or forfeiture of
      Restricted Stock Units, or diminution in value of Restricted Stock Units
      or Common Stock received in settlement thereof, and you irrevocably
      release Procter & Gamble from any such claim that may arise.

10.   DATA PRIVACY.

      By accepting a Restricted Stock Unit, you explicitly and unambiguously
consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of
your personal data as described in this document by and among, as applicable,
any Procter & Gamble entity or third party for the purpose of implementing,
administering and managing your participation in the Plan. You understand that
Procter & Gamble holds certain personal information about you, including without
limitation your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social
insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title,
any shares of stock or directorships held in a Procter & Gamble entity, details
of all options, Restricted Stock Units, or any other entitlement to shares of
stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your
favor, for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan
("Data"). You understand that Data may be transferred to any third parties
assisting in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan, that
these recipients may be located in your country or elsewhere, and that the
recipient's country may have different data privacy laws and protections than
your country. You understand that you may request a list with the names and
addresses of any potential recipients of Data by contacting your local human
resources representative. You authorize the recipients to receive, possess, use,
retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of
implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan,
including any requisite transfer of such Data to any broker or other third party
with whom you may elect to deposit any shares of Common Stock in connection with
the settlement of your Restricted Stock Units. You understand that Data will be
held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your
participation in the plan. You understand that you may, at any time, view Data,
request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require
any necessary amendments to Data, or refuse or withdraw the consents contained
in this paragraph, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local
human resources representative. You understand, however, that refusing or
withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the Plan. For
more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of
consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources
representative.

                    STATEMENT OF CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS

         THE PROCTER & GAMBLE 2001 STOCK AND INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN

      The shares of Common Stock of The Procter & Gamble Company (the
"Restricted Shares") awarded to you as stated in the accompanying letter have
been transferred to you on the express condition that these Restricted Shares,
and your ownership thereof, are subject to the following conditions and
restrictions:

1.    RESTRICTIONS AND CONDITIONS ON SHARES --

      (a) Neither these Restricted Shares nor any of your interest therein may
be sold, exchanged, transferred, pledged, hypothecated, given or otherwise
disposed of by you at any time except as specifically permitted or otherwise
required by the terms of this Statement.

      (b) In the event that your employment with Procter & Gamble terminates for
any reason except as set forth in Section 4(a)(ii) below prior to the vesting
date shown in the accompanying letter, you will be deemed to have received
delivery on the date of the termination of your employment a written demand by
the Company to sell to the Company within ten (10) days any of these Restricted
Shares where the conditions and restrictions have not lapsed as set forth in
paragraph 4 below at a price of ten cents ($.10) per share, which price is
subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided. For the purpose of this
subparagraph, your employment with Procter & Gamble shall not be deemed to
terminate by reason of your being on leave of absence for any purpose approved
in writing by the Company.

      (c) In the event that you shall at any time attempt to sell, exchange,
transfer, pledge, hypothecate, give or otherwise dispose of any of the
Restricted Shares, or any interest therein, in violation of the terms and
conditions of this Statement, you will be required, within ten (10) days after
delivery to you of a written demand by the Company made within ninety (90) days
after the occurrence of such event, to sell to the Company all Restricted Shares
then registered in your name with respect to which the conditions and
restrictions set forth in this Statement are still in effect at a price of ten
cents ($.10) per share, which price is subject to adjustment as hereinafter
provided.

      (d)   (i) The determination as to whether an event has occurred requiring
a sale of Restricted Shares to the Company in accordance with any provision of
this paragraph 1, paragraph 7 following or any other provision of this Statement
shall be made by the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") in its sole
discretion, and all determinations of the Committee with respect thereto shall
in all respects be conclusive upon you and any persons claiming under or through
you.

            (ii) If you shall at any time be required to sell any or all of
these Restricted Shares to the Company pursuant to any provisions of this
paragraph 1, paragraph 7 following or any other provision in this Statement, you
shall, effective on the date of the delivery or deemed delivery of the Company's
demand to you, cease to have any rights as a shareholder with respect to the
Restricted Shares so required to be sold, or any interest therein; and, without
limitation, you shall cease to be entitled to receive any future dividends upon
such Restricted Shares with record dates occurring after the date of delivery of
such demand; and in the event that for any reason you shall receive any such
dividends upon such Restricted Shares you will be required to repay the Company
an amount equal to such dividends.

<PAGE>

            (iii) If you shall at any time be required to sell any or all of
these Restricted Shares to the Company pursuant to the provisions of this
paragraph 1, paragraph 7 following or any other provision in this Statement, and
if within thirty (30) days after delivery or deemed delivery to you of the
Company's demand you have not delivered a stock power or other instrument of
transfer appropriately executed in blank, together with any certificates which
you may hold representing such Restricted Shares to the Secretary of the Company
at the Executive Offices of The Procter & Gamble Company, P. O. Box 599,
Cincinnati, Ohio 45201, the Company may thereupon cause to be mailed to you, in
the manner and at the address specified in paragraph 8(b) following, its check
payable to your order in the amount of the purchase price for such shares
provided for in this Statement and direct the Transfer Agent and Registrar of
the Company's Common Stock to make appropriate entries upon their records
showing the cancellation of such certificates and return the shares represented
thereby to the Company.

2.    SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS --

      Effective upon the date of award of these Restricted Shares you shall for
all purposes be a holder of record of these Restricted Shares and shall
thereafter have all rights of a common shareholder with respect to such shares
(including the right to vote such shares at any meeting of common shareholders
of The Procter & Gamble Company and the right to receive all dividends paid with
respect to such shares), subject only to the conditions and restrictions imposed
by this Statement. Until such conditions and restrictions have lapsed with
respect to any restricted Shares, any certificate for such shares will bear a
legend to the effect that they were issued or transferred subject to, and may be
sold or otherwise disposed of only in accordance with, the terms of this
Statement.

3.    ADJUSTMENTS IN CASE OF STOCK DIVIDENDS, STOCK SPLITS, ETC. --

      In the event that, as the result of a stock dividend, stock split,
recapitalization, merger, consolidation, reorganization, or other event, you
shall, as the owner of Restricted Shares, be entitled to new, additional or
different shares or securities: (a) such new, additional or different shares or
securities shall for all purposes be deemed "Restricted Shares," (b) all of the
terms of this Statement shall be applicable thereto as modified by this
paragraph 3, (c) the purchase price of ten cents ($.10) per share and all of the
computations provided for in this Statement shall, if and to the extent
required, be appropriately adjusted, and (d) any certificates or other
instruments evidencing such new, additional or different shares or securities
shall bear the legend referred to in paragraph 2; provided, however, any
fractional shares and any pre-emptive or other rights or warrants to purchase
securities issued to you as a holder of Restricted Shares in connection with a
public offering will be issued to you free and clear of all conditions and
restrictions imposed by this Statement.

4.    LAPSE OF CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS --

lapse on the dates set forth in the accompanying letter.

            (ii) In the event your employment with Procter & Gamble terminates
as a result of your death or permanent disability, the conditions and
restrictions on these Restricted Shares shall lapse in their entirety.

      (b) The Committee may accelerate the lapse of conditions and restrictions
on all or any part of the Restricted Shares in the case of hardship which in the
sole judgment of the Committee justifies such action.

      (c) When the conditions and restrictions lapse with respect to Restricted
Shares pursuant to this paragraph 4, the Company will deliver to you, or your
legal representative in case of death, promptly after surrender of any
certificate(s) for such Restricted Shares to the Treasurer of The Procter &
Gamble Company, Cincinnati, Ohio 45201, one or more certificates for a like
number of shares, free of any legend.

<PAGE>

5.    COMPANY RIGHT TO TERMINATE EMPLOYMENT AND OTHER REMEDIES --

      Nothing provided herein shall be construed to affect in any way the right
or power of the Company to terminate your employment at any time for any reason
with or without cause, nor to preclude the Company from taking any action or
enforcing any remedy available to it with respect to any action or conduct on
your part.

corporation so controlled by The Procter & Gamble Company, if and as long as
such corporations are so controlled.

shall meet the requirements of, and result in the application of, the rules
prescribed by Section 83 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as in effect at

contemporaneously herewith, and to take any other action, which may be effective
as of the date of award of these Restricted Shares, that, in the opinion of
counsel for the Company, may be necessary or desirable to carry out such
intention.

or document or to take any action requested by the Company or Committee to be
executed or taken by you pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 7(a) above for
a period of thirty (30) days after the date of such request, the Committee may
require you, within ten (10) days after delivery to you of a written demand by
the Company, to sell to the Company all of the Restricted Shares then registered

The Procter & Gamble Profit Sharing Trust and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (PST
Plan) is the oldest continuous profit sharing plan in the United States. This
year the Company celebrates the [number] anniversary of employee profit sharing!

As you know, the Company's contribution to your PST Plan account is a percentage
of the Base Wages paid to you during the Plan Year [date] while you were a
participant in the Plan. However, Federal Regulations limit the amount of wages
that can be used for making contributions to a qualified retirement plan, such
as the PST Plan. For the Plan Year ended [Date], the available wages were
limited to [amount].

The Company's strategy is to make up the difference between the allowable PST
Plan credit and what would otherwise be your credit (if wages were not limited)
by making a Retirement Supplement award in the form of stock with restrictions
until retirement. This credit in Restricted Stock is known as the ERISA Excess
(previously called the OBRA Excess), as ERISA, and its many amendments, is the
law that governs US qualified retirement plans. ERISA stands for the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act.

- -     Value of ERISA Excess Award for Restricted Stock allocation
      (based on wages of [amount]):                                    [amount]

NOTICE OF ERISA EXCESS AWARD: Your Restricted Stock account has now been updated
to include your [date] non-qualified retirement plan credit award. As a
reminder, we have a `certificateless" restricted stock system, so instead of
issuing a certificate to you for your [date] award, you can view your account
on-line.

As a reminder, if you are subject to U.S. taxation, you may make an Section
83(b) election, which includes the value of the restricted stock in your gross
income in the year it is granted. YOU MUST MAKE THE ELECTION WITHIN 30 DAYS OF
THE GRANT BY FILING THE REQUIRED NOTIFICATION WITH BOTH THE IRS AND THE COMPANY.
Attached is a general information sheet on the U.S. taxation of restricted
stock, including the tax consequences of the Section 83(b) election. You may
want to consult your personal tax advisor before making any Section 83(b)
election.

in all respects be conclusive upon you and any persons claiming under or through
you.

            (ii) If you shall at any time be required to sell any or all of
these Restricted Shares to the Company pursuant to any provisions of this
paragraph 1, paragraph 7 following or any other provision in this Statement, you
shall, effective on the date of the delivery of the Company's demand to you,

have not delivered a stock power or other instrument of transfer appropriately
executed in blank, together with any certificates which you may hold
representing such Restricted Shares to the Secretary of the Company at the

and at the address specified in paragraph 8(b) following, its check payable to
your order in the amount of the purchase price for such shares provided for in

Common Stock to make appropriate entries upon their records showing the

the Company.

      Effective upon the date of award of these Restricted Shares you shall for
all purposes be a holder of record of these Restricted Shares and shall
thereafter have all rights of a common shareholder with respect to such shares
(including the right to vote such shares at any meeting of common shareholders
of The Procter & Gamble Company and the right to receive all dividends paid with
respect to such shares), subject only to the conditions and restrictions imposed
by this Statement. Until such conditions and restrictions have lapsed with

recapitalization, merger, consolidation, reorganization, or other event, you
shall, as the owner of Restricted Shares, be entitled to new, additional or
different shares or securities: (a) such new, additional or different shares or
securities shall for all purposes be deemed "Restricted Shares," (b) all of the
terms of this Statement shall be applicable thereto as modified by this
paragraph 3, (c) the purchase price of ten cents ($.10) per share and all of the
computations provided for in this Statement shall, if and to the extent
required, be appropriately adjusted, and (d) any certificates or other
instruments evidencing such new, additional or different shares or securities
shall bear the legend referred to in paragraph 2; provided, however, any
fractional shares and any pre-emptive or other rights or warrants to purchase
securities issued to you as a holder of Restricted Shares in connection with a
public offering will be issued to you free and clear of all conditions and
restrictions imposed by this Statement.

4.    LAPSE OF CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS --

      (a) The conditions and restrictions set forth in paragraph 1 above shall
lapse in their entirety on the earliest of

            (i) the date your employment with Procter & Gamble terminates as the

permitted by the terms of a Procter & Gamble retirement plan in which you are
then a participant, provided, however, that the Treasurer of The Procter &
Gamble Company may agree to extend the restrictions to a date after retirement
to provide for expiration (a) on a date not later than December 15 of the year
of retirement; (b) on January 15 of the year following retirement; or (c) in
five or ten annual installments beginning on January 15 of the year following
retirement, with any such extension to be agreed to only upon your written

restrictions due to Company approval in writing of your planned retirement under
circumstances permitted by the terms of a Procter & Gamble retirement plan in
which you are then a participant. In no case will the Committee accept your
request to accelerate the lapse of conditions and restrictions prior to October
1 of the calendar year preceding the calendar year of your approved retirement.

      (b) The Committee may accelerate the lapse of conditions and restrictions
on all or any part of the Restricted Shares in the case of hardship which in the
sole judgment of the Committee justifies such action.

<PAGE>

      (c) When the conditions and restrictions lapse with respect to Restricted
Shares pursuant to this paragraph 4, the Company will deliver to you, or your
legal representative in case of death, promptly after surrender of any
certificate(s) for such Restricted Shares to the Treasurer of The Procter &

         The Procter & Gamble 2003 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Plan,
              and related correspondence and terms and conditions
<PAGE>

                THE PROCTER & GAMBLE 2003 NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS'
                                   STOCK PLAN

ARTICLE A -- PURPOSE.

      The purposes of The Procter & Gamble 2003 Non-Employee Directors' Stock
Plan (the "Plan") are to strengthen the alignment of interests between the
non-employee Directors ("Participants") and the shareholders of The Procter &
Gamble Company (the "Company") through ownership behavior and the increased
ownership of shares of the Company's common stock ("Common Stock"). This will be
accomplished by allowing each Participant to elect voluntarily to convert a
portion or all of his/her cash fees for services as a Director into Common Stock
or RSUs (as hereinafter defined), and by granting Participants (i) restricted
stock units or other awards related to the price of Common Stock ("RSUs"), (ii)
shares of Common Stock restricted in a manner determined by the Committee
("Restricted Shares"), (iii) non-qualified options to purchase shares of Common
Stock ("Stock Options"), and/or (iv) stock appreciation rights ("SARs").

ARTICLE B -- ADMINISTRATION.

1.    The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board
      of Directors of the Company (the "Board"), or such other committee as may
      be designated by the Board (the "Committee"). The Committee shall consist
      of not less than three (3) members of the Board who are "Non-Employee
      Directors" as defined in Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of
      1934 (the "1934 Act"), as amended, or any successor rule or definition
      adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or such other number of
      Non-Employee Directors required from time to time by such rule or any
      successor rule adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, to be
      appointed by the Board from time to time and to serve at the discretion of
      the Board. The Committee may establish such regulations, provisions, and
      procedures within the terms of the Plan as, in its opinion, may be
      advisable for the administration and operation of the Plan, and may
      designate the Secretary of the Company or other employees of the Company
      to assist the Committee in the administration and operation of the Plan
      and may grant authority to such persons to execute documents on behalf of
      the Committee. The Committee shall report to the Board on the
      administration of the Plan not less than once each year.

2.    Subject to the express provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have
      authority: (i) to allow Participants the right to elect to receive fees
      for services as a Director in either cash or an equivalent amount of whole
      shares of Common Stock or RSUs of the Company, or partly in cash and
      partly in whole shares of the Common Stock or RSUs of the Company, subject
      to such conditions or restrictions, if any, as the Committee may
      determine; (ii) to grant Participants Restricted Shares, subject to such
      conditions or restrictions, if any, as the Committee may determine; (iii)
      to grant RSUs, subject to such conditions or restrictions, if any, as the
      Committee may determine; (iv) to grant Participants Stock Options, subject
      to such conditions or restrictions, if any, as the Committee may
      determine; (v) to grant Participants SARs, subject to such conditions or
      restrictions, if any, as the Committee may determine; (vi) to make all
      other determinations it deems necessary or advisable for administering the
      Plan; and (vii) to provide for special terms for any RSUs, Restricted
      Shares, Stock Options, SARs or other awards granted to Participants who
      are foreign nationals or who reside outside of the United States of
      America in order to fairly accommodate for differences in local law, tax
      policy or custom

<PAGE>

      and to approve such supplements to or amendments, restatements or
      alternative versions of the Plan as the Committee may consider necessary
      or appropriate for such purposes (without affecting the terms of the Plan
      for any purpose); and to make all other determinations it deems necessary
      or advisable for administering the Plan.

ARTICLE C -- PARTICIPATION.

      Participation in the Plan shall be limited to non-employee Directors of
      the Company.

ARTICLE D -- LIMITATION ON NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE UNDER THE PLAN.

1.    The maximum aggregate number of shares available for grant under the Plan
      shall be 500,000 shares.

2.    In addition to the shares authorized for award by Paragraph 1 of this
      Article, the following shares may be awarded under the Plan:

      (a)   shares that were authorized to be awarded under The Procter & Gamble
            1993 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Plan (the "1993 Plan"), but that
            were not awarded under the 1993 Plan;

      (b)   shares awarded under the Plan or the 1993 Plan that are subsequently
            forfeited in accordance with the Plan or the 1993 Plan,
            respectively; or shares tendered by or withheld from a Participant
            in payment of all or part of the exercise price of a stock option
            awarded under the Plan or the 1993 Plan.

ARTICLE E -- SHARES SUBJECT TO USE UNDER THE PLAN.

      Shares of Common Stock to be granted by the Company or delivered by the
Company upon exercise of Stock Options shall be treasury shares.

ARTICLE F  - STOCK OPTIONS AND SARS

1.    The Committee may, from time to time, grant Participants one or more Stock
      Options to purchase shares of Common Stock, each having an exercise price
      equal to no less than the average of the high and low quotations for
      Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the day of the grant.

2.    The Committee may, from time to time, grant Participants one or more SARs
      each entitling the Participant to receive, upon exercise, a redemption
      differential for each such SAR which shall be the difference between the
      average of the high and low quotations for one share of Common Stock on
      the New York Stock Exchange on the date of exercise and the exercise price
      of the SAR then being exercised. The exercise price for each SAR granted
      under this Plan shall be the average of the high and low quotations for
      Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the day of the grant.

3.    Stock Options and SARs shall have a term of not less than ten (10) years
      from the date of grant, subject to earlier termination as provided herein,
      and shall be exerciseable one hundred percent (100%) not less than one (1)
      year from the date of grant, except in the case of death of a Participant,
      in which case such Participant's Stock Options or SARs shall immediately
      vest and be exercisable in accordance with this Article F.

<PAGE>

4.    In the case of death of a Participant, the persons to whom the Stock
      Options or SARs have been transferred by will or the laws of descent and
      distribution shall have the privilege of exercising remaining Stock
      Options or SARs or parts thereof, whether or not exercisable on the date
      of death of such Participant, at any time prior to the expiration date of
      such Stock Options or SARs.

5.    Stock Options are not transferable other than by will or by the laws of
      descent and distribution. For the purpose of exercising Stock Options or
      SARs after the death of the Participant, the duly appointed executors and
      administrators of the estate of the deceased Participant shall have the
      same rights with respect to the Stock Options and SARs as legatees or
      distributees would have after distribution to them from the Participant's
      estate, subject in all respects to Article J hereof.

6.    If a Participant ceases to be a Director while holding unexercised Stock
      Options or SARs, such Stock Options or SARs are then void, except in the
      case of (i) death, in which case such Stock Options or SARS may be
      transferred in accordance with this Article F and Article J hereof, (ii)
      disability, (iii) retirement at the end of a term, (iv) retirement after
      attaining the age of sixty nine (69), (v) resignation from the Board
      following a Participant's retirement from a principal employer in good
      standing under the terms of that employer's retirement plan, or (vi)
      resignation from the Board for reasons of antitrust laws or the Company's
      conflict of interest, corporate governance or continued service policies.
      In cases covered by (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) above, the Participant
      shall be immediately vested in his or her Stock Options or SARs subject to
      all other terms of such Stock Options or SARs.

7.    Upon the exercise of a Stock Option, payment in full of the exercise price
      shall be made by the Participant. The exercise price may be paid for by
      the Participant either in cash, shares of Common Stock to be valued at
      their fair market value on the date of exercise, or a combination thereof.

ARTICLE G -- ADJUSTMENTS.

      In the event of any future reorganization, recapitalization, stock split,
stock dividend, combination of shares, merger, consolidation, rights offering,
share exchange, reclassification, distribution, spin-off or other change
affecting the corporate structure, capitalization or Common Stock of the Company
occuring after the date of approval of the Plan by the Company's shareholders,
(i) the amount of shares authorized to be issued under the Plan, (ii) the number
of shares covered by outstanding Stock Options, SARs, Restricted Shares or RSUs,
and (iii) the exercise price of stock options or the grant price of SARs shall
be adjusted appropriately and equitably to prevent dilution or enlargement of
rights under the Plan. Following any such change, the term "Common Stock" shall
be deemed to refer to such class of shares or other securities as may be
applicable.

ARTICLE H  - GRANT OF COMMON STOCK, RESTRICTED SHARES OR RSUS.

1.    The Committee may grant Common Stock, Restricted Shares, or RSUs to
      Participants under the Plan subject to such conditions or restrictions, if
      any, as the Committee may determine.

2.    The shares granted under this Article H shall be valued at the average of
      the high and low

<PAGE>

      quotations for Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the day of
      the grant to a Participant. All shares granted shall be full shares,
      rounded up to the nearest whole share.

ARTICLE I -- ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS.

1.    The Board may, at any time, repeal the Plan or may amend it except that no
      such amendment may amend this paragraph, increase the total aggregate
      number of shares subject to the Plan, alter the persons eligible to
      receive shares under the Plan. Participants and the Company shall be bound
      by any such amendments as of their effective dates, but if any outstanding
      grants are materially affected adversely, notice thereof shall be given to
      Participants holding such grants and such amendments shall not be
      applicable without such Participant's written consent. If the Plan is
      repealed in its entirety, all theretofore granted shares subject to
      conditions or restrictions granted pursuant to the Plan shall continue to
      be subject to such conditions or restrictions. Notwithstanding this or any
      other provision of this Plan, Stock Options and SARs may not be re-priced
      or re-valued except in accordance with Article G hereof.

2.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, Stock Options and
      SARs granted hereunder shall vest immediately, and any conditions or
      restrictions on Common Stock, Restricted Stock or RSUs shall lapse, upon a
      "Change in Control." A "Change in Control" shall mean the occurrence of
      any of the following:

      (a)   An acquisition (other than directly from the Company) of any voting
            securities of the Company (the "Voting Securities") by any "Person"
            (as the term person is used for purposes of Section 13(d) or 14(d)
            of the 1934 Act), immediately after which such Person has
            "Beneficial Ownership" (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated
            under the 1934 Act) of twenty percent (20%) or more of the then
            outstanding shares or the combined voting power of the Company's
            then outstanding Voting Securities; provided, however, in
            determining whether a Change in Control has occurred pursuant to
            this Section 2(a), shares or Voting Securities which are acquired in
            a "Non-Control Acquisition" (as hereinafter defined) shall not
            constitute an acquisition which would cause a Change in Control. A
            "Non-Control Acquisition" shall mean an acquisition by (i) an
            employee benefit plan (or a trust forming a part thereof) maintained
            by (A) the Company or (B) any corporation or other Person of which a
            majority of its voting power or its voting equity securities or
            equity interest is owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company
            (for purposes of this definition, a "Related Entity"), (ii) the
            Company or any Related Entity, or (iii) any Person in connection
            with a "Non-Control Transaction" (as hereinafter defined);

      (b)   The individuals who, as of July 10, 2001 are members of the Board
            (the "Incumbent Board"), cease for any reason to constitute at least
            half of the members of the Board; or, following a Merger (as
            hereinafter defined) which results in a Parent Corporation (as
            hereinafter defined), the board of directors of the ultimate Parent
            Corporation; provided, however, that if the election, or nomination
            for election by the Company's common stockholders, of any new
            director was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the
            Incumbent Board, such new director shall, for purposes of the Plan,
            be considered as a member of the Incumbent Board; provided further,
            however, that no individual shall be considered a member of the
            Incumbent Board if such individual initially assumed office as a
            result of either an actual or threatened "Election Contest" (as
            described in Rule 14a-11 promulgated under the 1934 Act) or other
            actual or

<PAGE>

            threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a
            Person other than the Board (a "Proxy Contest") including by reason
            of any agreement intended to avoid or settle any Election Contest or
            Proxy Contest; or

      (c)   The consummation of:

            (i)   A merger, consolidation or reorganization with or into the
                  Company or in which securities of the Company are issued (a
                  "Merger"), unless such Merger is a "Non-Control Transaction".
                  A "Non-Control Transaction" shall mean a Merger where:

                  (A)   the stockholders of the Company, immediately before such
                        Merger own directly or indirectly immediately following
                        such Merger at least fifty percent (50%) of the combined
                        voting power of the outstanding voting securities of (x)
                        the corporation resulting from such Merger (the
                        "Surviving Corporation") if fifty percent (50%) or more
                        of the combined voting power of the then outstanding
                        voting securities of the Surviving Corporation is not
                        Beneficially Owned, directly or indirectly by another
                        Person (a "Parent Corporation"), or (y) if there is one
                        or more Parent Corporations, the ultimate Parent
                        Corporation;

                  (B)   the individuals who were members of the Incumbent Board
                        immediately prior to the execution of the agreement
                        providing for such Merger constitute at least half of
                        the members of the board of directors of (x) the
                        Surviving Corporation, if there is no Parent
                        Corporation, or (y) if there is one or more Parent
                        Corporations, the ultimate Parent Corporation; and

                  (C)   no Person other than (1) the Company, (2) any Related
                        Entity, (3) any employee benefit plan (or any trust
                        forming a part thereof) that, immediately prior to such
                        Merger was maintained by the Company or any Related
                        Entity, or (4) any Person who, immediately prior to such
                        merger, consolidation or reorganization had Beneficial
                        Ownership of twenty percent (20%) or more of the then
                        outstanding Voting Securities or shares, has Beneficial
                        Ownership of twenty percent (20%) or more of the
                        combined voting power of the outstanding voting
                        securities or common stock of (x) the Surviving
                        Corporation if there is no Parent Corporation, or (y) if
                        there is one or more Parent Corporations, the ultimate
                        Parent Corporation;

            (ii)  A complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company; or

            (iii) The sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of
                  the assets of the Company to any Person (other than a transfer
                  to a Related Entity or under conditions that would constitute
                  a Non-Control Transaction with the disposition of assets being
                  regarded as a Merger for this purpose or the distribution to
                  the Company's stockholders of the stock of a Related Entity or
                  any other assets).

      Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not be deemed to
occur solely because any Person (the "Subject Person") acquired Beneficial
Ownership of more than the permitted amount of the then outstanding shares or
Voting Securities as a result of the acquisition of shares or

<PAGE>

Voting Securities by the Company which, by reducing the number of shares or
Voting Securities then outstanding, increases the proportional number of shares
Beneficially Owned by the Subject Persons, provided that if a Change in Control
would occur (but for the operation of this sentence) as a result of the
acquisition of shares or Voting Securities by the Company, and after such share
acquisition by the Company, the Subject Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of
any additional shares or Voting Securities which increases the percentage of the
then outstanding shares or Voting Securities Beneficially Owned by the Subject
Person, then a Change in Control shall occur.

ARTICLE J --CONSENT.

      Every Participant who receives a grant of Common Stock, Stock Options,
SARs, Restricted Shares or RSUs pursuant to the Plan shall be bound by the terms
and provisions of the Plan and of any grant agreement referable thereto, and the
acceptance of any grant of shares or RSUs pursuant to the Plan shall constitute
a binding agreement between the Participant and the Company and any successors
in interest to any of them. Every person who receives Stock Options or SARs, in
accordance with Article F hereof, that a Participant received pursuant to the
Plan shall, in addition to such terms and conditions as the Committee may
require upon such grant, be bound by the terms and provisions of the Plan and of
the grant of Stock Options or SARs referable thereto, and the acceptance of any
grant of shares or RSUs by such person shall constitute a binding agreement
between such person and the Company and any successors in interest to any of
them. The Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of Ohio, United States of America.

ARTICLE K -- DURATION OF PLAN.

      The Plan shall be effective as of January 1, 2004 and terminate on
December 31, 2013 unless a different termination date is fixed by the
shareholders or by action of the Board but no such termination shall affect the
prior rights under the Plan of the Company or of anyone to whom Common Stock,
Stock Options, SARs, Restricted Shares or RSUs have been granted prior to such
termination.

                                                              Form RSU

                          THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY

          STATEMENT OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

          THE PROCTER & GAMBLE 2003 NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS' STOCK PLAN

      The Restricted Stock Units awarded to you as set forth in the letter you
received from the Company (your "Award Letter"), and your ownership thereof, are
subject to the following terms and conditions.

1.    DEFINITIONS.

      For purposes of this Statement of Terms and Conditions for Restricted
Stock Units ("Terms and Conditions"), all capitalized terms not defined in these
Terms and Conditions will have the meanings described in The Procter & Gamble
2003 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Plan (the "Plan"), and the following terms
will have the following meanings.

      (a) "AGREED SETTLEMENT DATE" has the meaning described in Section 2(c);

      (b) "DATA" has the meaning described in Section 8;

      (c) "DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS" has the meaning described in Section 3;

      (d) "FORFEITURE DATE" is the date identified as such in your Award Letter;

      (e) "FORFEITURE PERIOD" means the period from the Grant Date until the
      Forfeiture Date.

      (f) "GRANT DATE" means the date a Restricted Stock Unit was awarded to
      you, as identified in your Award Letter;

      (g) "ORIGINAL SETTLEMENT DATE" is the date identified as such in your
      Award Letter, as adjusted, if applicable, by Section 2;

      (h) "POST-FORFEITURE PERIOD" means the period from the Forfeiture Date
      until the later of the Original Settlement Date or the Agreed Settlement
      Date;

      (i) "PROCTER & GAMBLE" means the Company and/or its Subsidiaries;

      (j) "RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT" means an unfunded, unsecured promise by the
      Company, in accordance with these Terms and Conditions and the provisions
      of the Plan, to issue to you one share of Common Stock on the later of the
      Original Settlement Date or the Agreed Settlement Date.

2.    TRANSFER AND RESTRICTIONS.

      (a) Neither Restricted Stock Units nor your interest in them may be sold,
      exchanged, transferred, pledged, hypothecated, given or otherwise disposed
      of by you at any time, except by will or by the laws of descent and
      distribution. Any attempted transfer of a Restricted Stock Unit, whether
      voluntary or involuntary on your part, will result in the immediate
      forfeiture to the

<PAGE>

      Company, and cancellation, of the Restricted Stock Unit (including all
      rights to receive Dividend Equivalents).

      (b) During the Forfeiture Period, your Restricted Stock Units (including
      all rights to receive Dividend Equivalents) will be forfeited and
      cancelled if you leave your position as a Director of the Company for any
      reason, except due to your: (i) disability; (ii) retirement after
      attaining the age of sixty-nine (69); (iii) resignation following
      retirement from your principal employer in good standing under the terms
      or your principal employer's retirement plan; or (iv) resignation for
      reasons of antitrust laws or the Company's conflict of interest, corporate
      governance or continued service policies. In the event of your disability
      during the Forfeiture Period, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the
      Company, your Original Settlement Date shall automatically and immediately
      become, without any further action by you or the Company, the date of your
      disability. In the event of any of the other above exceptions occurring,
      you will retain your Restricted Stock Units subject to the Plan and these
      Terms and Conditions.

      (c) At any time at least one calendar year prior to the Original
      Settlement Date, you and the Company may agree to postpone the date on
      which you are entitled to receive one share of Common Stock for each
      Restricted Stock Unit you hold until January 15th of any later year (the
      "Agreed Settlement Date"). During the Post-Forfeiture Period, you will
      retain your Restricted Stock Units subject to the Plan and these Terms and
      Conditions if you leave your position as a Director for any reason, except
      due to your disability. In the event of your disability during the
      Post-Forfeiture Period, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the
      Company, your Original Settlement Date or Agreed Settlement Date, as
      applicable, shall automatically and immediately become, without any
      further action by you or the Company, the date of your disability.

      (d) Upon your death or the occurrence of a Change in Control at any time
      while you hold Restricted Stock Units and/or Dividend Equivalents, your
      Original Settlement Date or Agreed Settlement Date, as applicable, will
      automatically and immediately become, without any further action by you or
      the Company, the date of your death or of the Change in Control, as
      applicable.

      (e) From time to time, the Company and/or the Committee may establish
      procedures with which you must comply in order to accept an award of
      Restricted Stock Units, to agree to an Agreed Settlement Date, or to
      settle your Restricted Stock Units, including requiring you to do so by
      means of electronic signature, or charging you an administrative fee for
      doing so.

      (f) Once your Restricted Stock Units have been settled by delivery to you
      of an equivalent number of shares of Common Stock, the Restricted Stock
      Units will have no further value, force or effect and you will cease to
      receive Dividend Equivalents associated with the Restricted Stock Units.

3.    DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS.

      As a holder of Restricted Stock Units, during the period from the Grant
Date until the Original Settlement Date or the Agreed Settlement Date, whichever
is later, each time a cash dividend or other cash distribution is paid with
respect to Common Stock, you will receive additional Restricted Stock Units
("Dividend Equivalents"). The number of such additional Restricted Stock Units
will be determined as follows: multiply the number of Restricted Stock Units
currently held by the per share amount of the cash dividend or other cash
distribution on the Common Stock, and then divide the result by the price of the
Common Stock on the date of the dividend or distribution. These Dividend
Equivalent Restricted Stock Units will be subject to the same terms and
conditions as the original Restricted Stock Units that gave rise to them,
including forfeiture and settlement terms, except that if there is a fractional
number of Dividend Equivalent Restricted Stock Units on the date they are to be
settled, you will receive one share of Common Stock for the fractional Dividend
Equivalent Restricted Stock Units.

<PAGE>

4.    VOTING AND OTHER SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS.

      A Restricted Stock Unit is not a share of Common Stock, and thus you are
not entitled to any voting, dividend or other rights as a shareholder of the
Company with respect to the Restricted Stock Units you hold.

5.    ADJUSTMENTS IN CASE OF STOCK DIVIDENDS, STOCK SPLITS, ETC.

      In the event of a future reorganization, recapitalization, stock split,
stock dividend, combination of shares, merger, consolidation, rights offering,
share exchange, reclassification, distribution, spin-off, or other change
affecting the corporate structure, capitalization or Common Stock, the number of
Restricted Stock Units you hold will be adjusted appropriately and equitably to
prevent dilution or enlargement of your rights.

6.    TAX WITHHOLDING.

      To the extent Procter & Gamble is required to withhold federal, state,
local or foreign taxes in connection with your Restricted Stock Units or
Dividend Equivalents, the Committee may require you to make such arrangements as
Procter & Gamble may deem appropriate for the payment of such taxes required to
be withheld, including without limitation, relinquishment of some of the shares
of Common Stock that would otherwise be given to you. However, regardless of any
action taken by Procter & Gamble with respect to any income tax, social
insurance, payroll tax, or other tax, by accepting a Restricted Stock Unit or
Dividend Equivalent, you acknowledge that the ultimate liability for any such
tax owed by you is and remains your responsibility, and that Procter & Gamble
makes no representations about the tax treatment of your Restricted Stock Units
or Dividend Equivalents, and does not commit to structure any aspect of the
Restricted Stock Units or Dividend Equivalents to reduce or eliminate your tax
liability.

7.    SUSPENSION PERIODS AND TERMINATION.

      The Company reserves the right from time to time to temporarily suspend
your right to settle your Restricted Stock Units for shares of Common Stock
where such suspension is deemed by the Company as necessary or appropriate.

8.    DATA PRIVACY.

      By accepting a Restricted Stock Unit, you explicitly and unambiguously
consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of
your personal data as described in this document by and among, as applicable,
any Procter & Gamble entity or third party for the purpose of implementing,
administering and managing your participation in the Plan. You understand that
Procter & Gamble holds certain personal information about you, including without
limitation your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social
insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title,
any shares of stock or directorships held in a Procter & Gamble entity, details
of all options, Restricted Stock Units, or any other entitlement to shares of
stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your
favor, for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan
("Data"). You understand that Data may be transferred to any third parties
assisting in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan, that
these recipients may be located in your country or elsewhere, and that the
recipient's country may have different data privacy laws and protections than
your country. You understand that you may request a list with the names and
addresses of any potential recipients of Data by contacting your local human
resources representative. You authorize the recipients to receive, possess, use,
retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of
implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan,
including any requisite transfer of such Data to any broker or other third party
with whom you may elect to deposit any shares of Common Stock in connection with
the settlement of your Restricted Stock Units. You understand that Data will be
held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your
<PAGE>

participation in the plan. You understand that you may, at any time, view Data,
request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require
any necessary amendments to Data, or refuse or withdraw the consents contained
in this paragraph, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local
human resources representative. You understand, however, that refusing or
withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the Plan. For
more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of
consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources
representative.

                                   STOCK PLAN

      The shares of Common Stock of The Procter & Gamble Company (the "Company")
awarded to you as stated in the accompanying letter (the "Restricted Shares")
have been transferred to you on the express condition that these Restricted
Shares, and your ownership thereof, are subject to the following conditions and
restrictions:

1.    RESTRICTIONS AND CONDITIONS ON SHARES --

      (a) Neither these Restricted Shares nor any of your interest therein may
be sold, exchanged, transferred, pledged, hypothecated, given or otherwise
disposed of by you at any time except as specifically permitted or otherwise
required by the terms of this Statement.

      (b) In the event that you cease to be a member of the Board of Directors
of the Company (the "Board") as a result of a Disqualifying Termination (as
defined below), you will be deemed to have received on the date of the
termination of your membership a written demand by the Company to sell to the
Company within ten (10) days these Restricted Shares at a price of ten cents

A "Disqualifying Termination" shall include any termination of your membership
on the Board for reasons of cause (a criminal act, an act of fraud, breach of
trust or other act of gross conduct) or your voluntary resignation from the
Board prior to the end of a term. However, "Disqualifying Termination" will not
include resignation from the Board prior to the end of a term if it is for
reasons of the antitrust laws, conflict of interest, corporate governance or
continued service policies, death, disability, your retirement from your
principal employer under the terms of an appropriate retirement plan or your
attainment of the age of 69.

      (c) In the event that you shall at any time attempt to sell, exchange,
transfer, pledge, hypothecate, give or otherwise dispose of any of the
Restricted Shares, or any interest therein, in violation of the terms and
conditions of this Statement, you will be required, within ten (10) days after
delivery to you of a written demand by the Company made within ninety (90) days
after the occurrence of such event, to sell to the Company all Restricted Shares
then registered in your name with respect to which the conditions and
restrictions set forth in this Statement are still in effect at a price of ten
cents ($.10) per share, which price is subject to adjustment as hereinafter
provided.

      (d)   (i) The determination as to whether an event has occurred requiring
a sale of Restricted Shares to the Company in accordance with any provision of
this paragraph 1, paragraph 5, following, or any other provision of this

(including the right to vote such shares at any meeting of common shareholders
of The Procter & Gamble Company and the right to receive all dividends paid with

3.    ADJUSTMENTS IN CASE OF STOCK DIVIDENDS, STOCK SPLITS, ETC. --

      In the event that, as the result of a stock dividend, stock split,

on all or any part of the Restricted Shares in the case of hardship which in the

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY
DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN

ARTICLE 1. PURPOSE, STATUS, AND EFFECTIVE DATE

      1.1   PURPOSE OF PLAN. The Procter & Gamble Company (the "Company"), an
Ohio corporation, has adopted The Procter & Gamble Company Executive Deferred
Compensation Plan (the "Plan"), as set forth herein, as a means of rewarding and
retaining selected employees and providing such individuals the opportunity for
capital accumulation through elective deferrals of compensation.

      1.2   STATUS OF PLAN. The Company has established the Plan as an unfunded
deferred compensation plan for a select group of management and highly
compensated employees within the meaning of Sections 201(2), 301(3), and 401(1)
of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. The Plan
shall at all times be administered and interpreted in a manner that is
consistent with such status.

      1.3   EFFECTIVE DATE. The Effective Date of the Plan is July 1, 2004.

ARTICLE 2. DEFINITIONS

      Whenever used in this Plan, the following terms shall have the meanings
set forth below and, when the meaning is intended, the initial letter of the
word is capitalized.

      (a)   "ACCOUNT" shall mean the bookkeeping account for a Participant that
            is established and maintained to record the Participant's interest
            under the Plan. The balance posted to the record of the Account of a
            Participant shall reflect the Participant's Contributions,
            distributions, adjustments for income, gain, or loss, and other
            charges and credits pursuant to Article 6.

      (b)   "ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE" shall mean the committee that administers
            the Short-Term Achievement Reward incentive plan or such other
            administrative committee of the Company appointed by the
            Compensation Committee to administer the Plan. Pursuant to Section
            9.2, the Administrative Committee has the authority to delegate its
            responsibilities. Throughout this plan document, the term
            "Administrative Committee" shall also include any individual to whom
            the Administrative Committee has delegated its responsibilities
            pursuant to Section 9.2.

      (c)   "BENEFICIARY" shall mean the person or persons or entity designated
            by the Participant to receive the balance of the Participant's
            Account in the event of the Participant's death. The designation may
            be in favor of one or more Beneficiaries, may include contingent as
            well as primary designations and named or unnamed trustees under any
            will or trust agreement and may apportion the benefits payable in
            any manner among the Beneficiaries. A Participant's designation of
            one or more Beneficiaries shall be made in writing in a manner
            designated by the Administrative Committee and shall not be
            effective until received by the Administrative Committee. If a
            Participant fails to properly designate a Beneficiary or if the
            designated beneficiaries of such Participant shall have predeceased
            the Participant, the Participant's estate shall be the Beneficiary.

<PAGE>

            A Participant may change his or her Beneficiary without the consent
            of any Beneficiary by similar instrument in accordance with rules
            and procedures established by the Administrative Committee. The
            beneficiary designation form received and acknowledged most recently
            by the Administrative Committee shall control as of any date. If
            concurrent Beneficiaries are named without specifying the proportion
            of benefits due each, distribution shall be made in equal shares to
            those Beneficiaries.

            as it may be amended from time to time. Furthermore, the phrase "to

            described does not cause taxation of a Participant's Account prior

      (f)   "COMPANY" shall mean The Procter & Gamble Company, an Ohio
            corporation, and any successor thereto which continues the Plan.

      (g)   "COMPENSATION" shall mean the definition of compensation for the
            Plan Year announced in writing by the Administrative Committee on or

            until superceded, the definition of compensation announced by the

            subsequent Plan Years.

      (h)   "COMPENSATION COMMITTEE" shall mean the Compensation Committee of
            the Board of Directors, as constituted from time to time, of the
            Company. If the Compensation Committee has delegated any of its
            authority under the Plan to a committee or to an individual, the
            term "Compensation Committee" shall also include such committee or
            individual.

      (i)   "CONTRIBUTIONS" shall mean Deferrals.

      (j)   "DEFERRAL ELECTION" shall mean the election or elections filed by

            Sharing Trust and Employee Stock Ownership Plan under The Procter &
            Gamble Profit Sharing Trust and Employee Stock Ownership Plan's
            procedures for disability claims. In addition, where the context so
            requires, "Disability" shall mean a termination of employment by

            subsidiary of the Company for whom the person performs services)
            shall not be an Employee for purposes of the Plan, notwithstanding
            that such person may be later determined by the Internal Revenue
            Service or by a court of competent jurisdiction to be an employee.

      (p)   "EMPLOYER" shall mean, with respect to any Participant, the Company
            or, if applicable, a subsidiary of the Company (that is

            Committee) that employs such Participant.

            pooled separate account, or other benchmark selected by the
            Administrative Committee pursuant to Section 6.2 for measuring the

            Section 3.1(b) of the Plan.

<PAGE>

                     Participant's selection for eligibility or eligibility
                     criteria under Sections 3.1(a) and 3.1(b) hereof at any

ARTICLE 4. CONTRIBUTIONS AND CREDITS

      4.1   DEFERRALS.

            (a)   A Participant may elect to make Deferrals to his or her
                  Account for a Plan Year by timely executing and filing a
                  Deferral Election with the Administrative Committee on or
                  before the due date established by the Administrative
                  Committee for the Plan Year for which the Deferral Election is
                  being made. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of
                  this Section 4.1, such due date shall be prior to January 1 of
                  the Plan Year for which the Compensation would otherwise be
                  payable.

            (b)   The Administrative Committee may provide for separate Deferral
                  Elections and due dates for the various elements of
                  Compensation, such as base salary and bonuses. Any Deferral
                  Election must be made prior to the period for which the
                  element of Compensation being deferred is earned, as
                  determined by the Administrative Committee in its sole
                  discretion, and the Participant's Deferral Election shall only
                  apply to Compensation earned after the date on which it is
                  received by the Administrative Committee.

            (c)   A Participant who first becomes eligible for participation in
                  the Plan after January 1 of a Plan Year who wishes to make
                  Deferrals to his or her Account for such Plan Year shall
                  execute and file with the Administrative Committee a Deferral
                  Election within thirty (30) days after the date on which such
                  Participant is notified that he or she has become eligible to
                  participate in the Plan. For this purpose, the date of the
                  notice shall be the date of notification, regardless of when
                  actually received by the Participant.

            (d)   Only one Deferral Election may be made for each element of
                  Compensation earned in a single Plan Year (or earned over a
                  period of more than one Plan Year). Any Participant who fails
                  to timely execute and file a Deferral Election with the
                  Administrative Committee for a Plan Year with respect to an
                  element of Compensation shall not be permitted to make
                  Deferrals for such element of Compensation for such Plan Year.

            (e)   A Deferral Election shall direct the Employer to reduce the
                  Participant's Compensation (or the element thereof) by a whole
                  percentage specified by the Participant in the Deferral
                  Election.

<PAGE>

            (f)   The amount specified by the Participant in the Deferral
                  Election cannot reduce the Participant's current Compensation
                  for such Plan Year below the amount necessary to satisfy any
                  applicable taxes and withholdings required by law, as
                  determined by the Administrative Committee.

            (g)   A Deferral Election for Compensation shall be effective only
                  for the Plan Year for which it is made. Once filed with the
                  Administrative Committee, a Deferral Election shall be
                  irrevocable.

            (h)   In making a Deferral Election, a Participant consents to the
                  Employer's withholding from his or her currently payable
                  Compensation the amount or amounts elected and the crediting
                  of such withheld amounts to the Participant's Account, as
                  provided in the Plan.

      4.2   AUTOMATIC CANCELLATION OF DEFERRAL ELECTIONS. Notwithstanding
anything in the Plan to the contrary, in the event the Participant ceases to be
a Participant, all of such Participant's outstanding Deferral Elections shall
immediately be cancelled, and the Participant's right to make future Deferral
Elections shall be suspended until the Participant again becomes a Participant.

ARTICLE 5. VESTING

      A Participant shall at all times be one hundred percent (100%) vested in
amounts credited to the Participant's Account.

ARTICLE 6. PARTICIPANT ACCOUNTS; INVESTMENT OPTIONS

      6.1   ACCOUNTS. The Administrative Committee shall establish an Account
for each Participant to record the Contributions, distributions, adjustments for
income, gain, or loss, and other charges and credits to the Account under the
Plan.

      6.2   INVESTMENT OPTIONS. The Administrative Committee shall designate one
or more Investment Options for measuring the income, gain, or loss, and other
charges and credits recorded for a Participant's Account and may change
Investment Options prospectively at any time provided that any Investment
Options designated must be comparable to an investment option available under a
tax-qualified defined contribution plan of the Company. Notwithstanding anything
in this Plan to the contrary, an Investment Option that provides an above-market
return, as defined by Item 402 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933,
may not be designated without the approval of the Compensation Committee.

      6.3   PARTICIPANT ALLOCATIONS.

            (a)   A Participant shall elect on his or her Deferral Election form
                  or on such other form or by such other means as may be
                  specified by the Administrative Committee, one or more
                  Investment Options to which Contributions to be credited to
                  the Participant's Account shall be allocated. A Participant
                  may change the allocation of future Contributions among the
                  Investment Options and may change the allocation of his or her
                  Account balance among the Investment Options as frequently as
                  permitted by the Administrative Committee under rules and
                  procedures applicable to all Participants. The Administrative
                  Committee shall establish and may prospectively change its
                  rules regarding the timing and

<PAGE>

                  frequency of Investment Option elections and may establish
                  minimum amounts or percentages for allocating Contributions
                  and transferring Account balances among the Investment
                  Options.

            (b)   In the event a Participant fails or refuses to make an
                  election allocating Contributions credited to his or her
                  Account among the then available Investment Options, the
                  Administrative Committee shall, in its discretion, either: (i)
                  reject the Participant's Deferral Election as incomplete, or
                  (ii) specify the Investment Option or Options to which the
                  Participant's Account shall be allocated and notify the
                  Participant of its selection, which notification may be the
                  Account statements provided to the Participant.

      6.4   ADJUSTMENT OF ACCOUNTS. A Participant's Account balance shall be
adjusted daily, based on the performance of the Investment Options selected by
the Participant, as if the portion of the Participant's Account allocated to an
Investment Option were actually invested in such Investment Option and adjusted
for other amounts as if such other amounts were actually charged or credited to
an actual Account balance of the Participant. The Administrative Committee may
also charge as an expense against a Participant's Account: (i) amounts
customarily charged by the sponsor of one or more Investment Options that are
charged on a per-Participant or per-transaction basis and not otherwise charged
as an expense of an Investment Option, and (ii) the Administrative Committee's
and the Employer's own expenses and out-of-pocket fees in administering the
Plan. The Administrative Committee's allocation of charges and expenses among
Participant Accounts shall be final and conclusive against the Participants and
all other parties.

      6.5   STATUS OF INVESTMENT OPTIONS. The Investment Options established by
the Administrative Committee from time to time are for the sole purpose of
providing a performance measurement for adjusting Participants' Accounts for
income, gain, or loss, and other charges and credits. Notwithstanding anything
in this Plan to the contrary, neither the Company nor the Administrative
Committee shall be required to actually invest monies in any fund designated as
an Investment Option, any decision to so invest shall remain within the
discretion of the Company (subject to the approval of the Compensation
Committee), and any amounts so invested shall remain the property of the
Company.

ARTICLE 7. DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS

      7.1   DISTRIBUTION ELECTION.

            (a)   At the time each Deferral Election is made, the Participant
                  may elect to receive a distribution of all or a portion of the
                  related amount deferred (including adjustments thereon
                  pursuant to Section 6.4) upon the first to occur of the
                  Participant's Retirement or termination of employment by
                  reason of Disability.

            (b)   A Participant may instead elect to receive a Scheduled
                  In-Service Withdrawal of up to one hundred percent (100%) of
                  the related amount deferred (including adjustments thereon
                  pursuant to Section 6.4); provided, however, that any
                  Scheduled In-Service Withdrawal must occur at least one (1)
                  year after the end of the Plan Year in which the Deferrals
                  being distributed were credited to the Participant's Account.

<PAGE>

            (c)   Separate distribution elections may be made for each Plan
                  Year's credited Contributions. The Participant's distribution
                  election shall be made in writing as specified by the
                  Administrative Committee.

      7.2   RETIREMENT/DISABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS.

            (a)   A Participant may elect one or both of the following forms of
                  distribution for his or her Account distributable by reason of
                  the Participant's Retirement or Disability: (i) a single sum
                  distribution, or (ii) a distribution in approximately equal
                  annual installments payable over a period of two (2) to ten
                  (10) years. The Account balance of a Participant who fails or
                  refuses to elect a method of distribution shall be paid in a
                  single sum.

            (b)   A distribution payable by reason of the Participant's
                  Retirement or Disability shall be paid (in the case of a
                  single sum) or commence to be paid (in the case of annual
                  payments) as soon as practicable in the calendar year
                  following the calendar year in which the Participant's
                  Retirement or Disability occurs.

      7.3   DEATH DISTRIBUTIONS. If a Participant dies before a complete
distribution of his or her Account under the Plan has occurred, the
Participant's undistributed Account balance shall commence to be distributed to
his or her Beneficiary under the distribution method (for death) elected by the
Participant as soon as administratively possible following receipt by the
Administrative Committee of satisfactory notice and confirmation of the
Participant's death.

      7.4   SCHEDULED IN-SERVICE WITHDRAWALS.

            (a)   A Scheduled In-Service Withdrawal shall be paid in a single
                  sum as soon as practicable in the January of the payout year
                  elected by the Participant to receive such Scheduled
                  In-Service Withdrawal.

            (b)   If a Participant has elected a Scheduled In-Service Withdrawal
                  for all or a portion of his or her Account, but terminates
                  employment with all Employers for any reason other than
                  Disability or death prior to the year specified by the
                  Participant for such Scheduled In-Service Withdrawal to be
                  paid, the Scheduled In-Service Withdrawal shall be paid in the
                  year following the year employment terminates.

            (c)   If a Participant terminates employment with all Employers by
                  reason of Disability or death prior to the year specified by
                  the Participant for such Scheduled In-Service Withdrawal to be
                  paid, the Scheduled In-Service Withdrawal distribution shall
                  be distributed in the manner elected by the Participant for
                  Disability or death. However, if Disability or death occurs
                  within a Plan Year during which a Scheduled In-Service
                  Withdrawal is still to be paid, such withdrawal shall be paid
                  as scheduled to the Participant (or in the event of death, to
                  the Participant's estate).

      7.5   TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT. If a Participant terminates employment
with all Employers prior to his or her Retirement, death, or Disability for any
reason, notwithstanding any distribution election made by the Participant, the
undistributed portion of the Participant's Account

<PAGE>

balance shall be payable to the Participant in a single sum in January following
the calendar year in which such termination of employment occurs.

      7.6   FORM OF DISTRIBUTIONS. All amounts distributed to a Participant from
his or her Account shall be paid in cash by the Employer or its designee.

      7.7   POSTPONEMENT OF DISTRIBUTIONS. The Administrative Committee may
postpone the distribution of all or part of an amount otherwise payable to a
Participant to the extent that the distribution would not be deductible by the
Employer under Section 162(m) of the Code. A conversion or distribution that is
so postponed pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall be converted and/or paid as soon
as it is possible to do so within the deduction limitations of Section 162(m) of
the Code.

      7.8   PERMITTED CHANGES IN DISTRIBUTION ELECTIONS. To the extent permitted
under the Code and by the Administrative Committee, a Participant may change his
or her distribution election related to amount(s) distributable by reason of his
or her Disability or death if such change is made in writing at least twelve
(12) months prior to the Participant's Disability or death and only if such
change will not result in taxation of amounts previously deferred. In the event
that the Participant's most recent form of distribution election was made within
twelve (12) months of the Participant's Disability or death, the next most
recent election made by the Participant at least twelve (12) months prior to the
Participant's termination of employment by reason of Disability or death (or if
none, the Participant's initial election) shall be used.

ARTICLE 8. CLAIMS PROCEDURES

      8.1   GENERALLY. A distribution request (also referred to herein as a

                           ambiguities, inconsistencies, or omissions, and
                           decisions on claims which shall, subject to the
                           claims procedures under the Plan, be conclusive and

                           benefits;

                  (iii)    To prepare and distribute, in such manner as the
                           Administrative Committee determines to be
                           appropriate, information explaining the Plan;

                  (iv)     To receive from the Employer and from Participants
                           such information as shall be necessary for the proper

                  (vii)    To appoint or employ individuals to assist in the
                           administration of the Plan and any other agents it

                           and other services as it may require in carrying out
                           the provisions of the Plan or in connection with any
                           legal claim or proceeding involving the Plan, to
                           settle, compromise, contest, prosecute, or abandon
                           claims in favor of or against the Plan; and

                  (viii)   To discharge all other duties set forth herein.

            (b)   The Administrative Committee shall have no power to add to,
                  subtract from, or modify any of the terms of the Plan, or to
                  change or add to any benefits provided by the Plan, or to
                  waive or fail to apply any requirements of eligibility under
                  the Plan. No member of the Administrative Committee shall
                  participate in any action on any matters involving solely his
                  or her own rights or benefits as a Participant under the Plan,
                  and any such matters shall be determined by the Compensation
                  Committee.

      9.3   ACTIONS BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE. The Administrative
Committee may act at a meeting or by writing without a meeting, by the vote or
assent of a majority of its members. The Administrative Committee may adopt such
bylaws and regulations as it deems desirable for the conduct of its affairs and
the administration of the Plan. A dissenting Administrative Committee member
who, within a reasonable time after he or she has knowledge of any action or
failure to act

<PAGE>

by the majority, registers his or her dissent in writing delivered to the other
Administrative Committee members shall not be responsible for any such action or
failure to act.

      9.4   EXPENSES OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE. Members of the
Administrative Committee shall not receive compensation from the Plan for those
services they perform as the Administrative Committee members while employed by
an Employer. Any and all necessary expenses related to Plan administration shall

      9.5   RECORDS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE. The Administrative
Committee shall keep a record of all of its meetings and shall keep all such
books of account, records, and other data as may be necessary or desirable in
its judgment for the administration of the Plan.

Participant's current mailing address.

      9.7   NOTIFICATION OF PARTICIPANT'S ADDRESS. Each Participant, retired
Participant, and Beneficiary entitled to benefits under the Plan must file with
the Administrative Committee or such other person designated by the
Administrative Committee, in writing, his or her post office address and each
change of post office address. Any communication, statement, or notice addressed
to such a person at this latest post office address as filed with the
Administrative Committee shall, on deposit in the United States mail with
postage prepaid, be binding upon such person for all purposes of the Plan, and
the Administrative Committee shall not be obliged to search for, or ascertain
the whereabouts of, any such person.

      9.8   INDEMNIFICATION. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the
contrary, no member of the Administrative Committee nor any individual to whom
the Administrative Committee has delegated duties under this Plan shall be
liable to any Participant, former Participant, designated Beneficiary, or any
other person for any claim, loss, liability, or expense incurred in connection
with the Plan, unless attributable to fraud or willful misconduct on the part of
such member or individual. Furthermore, members of the Administrative Committee
and all individuals to whom the Administrative Committee has delegated duties
under this Plan shall be indemnified by the Company against any and all
liabilities arising by reason of any act or failure to act made in good faith
pursuant to the provisions of the Plan, including expenses reasonably incurred
in the defense of any claim relating thereto.

ARTICLE 10. AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

      The Company hereby reserves the right, by written resolution of the
Compensation Committee, to amend or terminate the Plan at any time, and for any
reason, without the consent of any Participant. No amendment shall impair or
curtail the Employer's contractual obligations to a Participant for the vested
portion of the Participant's Account prior to the date of any such amendment or
termination of the Plan.

<PAGE>

ARTICLE 11. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS

      11.1  NO CONTRACT. Nothing in the Plan shall be deemed to give a
Participant any right to be retained in the employ of the Employer or to
interfere with the Employer's right to discharge the Participant at any time,
with or without cause.

      11.2  WITHHOLDINGS. The Employer shall withhold from any amount
distributable to a Participant under the Plan any applicable actual or
hypothetical federal, state, or local income or employment taxes or any other
amounts required to be withheld by law or withheld pursuant to Section 11.4. In
addition, the Employer may withhold from a Participant's currently payable
salary, bonus, or other compensation any applicable federal, state, or local
income or employment taxes that may be due upon the crediting of an amount to
the Participant's Account.

      11.3  RIGHTS NOT TRANSFERABLE. Neither a Participant nor any other person
shall have any right to commute, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, anticipate,
mortgage, or otherwise encumber, transfer, hypothecate, alienate, or convey in
advance of actual receipt, the amounts, if any, payable hereunder, or any part
thereof, which are, and all rights to which are expressly declared to be,
unassignable and nontransferable. No part of the amounts payable shall, prior to
actual payment, be subject to seizure, attachment, garnishment, or sequestration
for the payment of any debts, judgments, alimony, or separate maintenance owed
by a Participant or any other person, be transferable by operation of law in the
event of a Participant's or any other person's bankruptcy or insolvency or be
transferable to a spouse as a result of a property settlement or otherwise.

      11.4  OFFSET. If, at the time payments or installments of payments are to
be made hereunder, the Participant or Beneficiary or both are indebted or
obligated to the Company, then the remaining payments under the Plan to be made
to the Participant or the Beneficiary or both may, at the discretion of the
Company, be reduced by the amount of the indebtedness or obligation, provided,
however, that an election by the Company not to reduce any such payment or
payments shall not constitute a waiver of its claim for such indebtedness or
obligation or a waiver of its right to make an offset against payments in the
future.

      11.5  NO FUNDING. The Plan constitutes a mere promise of the Employer to
make payments in accordance with the terms of the Plan. This Plan does not give
any Participant or his or her Beneficiary any interest, lien, or claim in or
against any specific assets of the Employer. The Participant and his or her
Beneficiary shall have only the rights of general, unsecured creditors of the
Employer with respect to their rights under the Plan.

      The Company may, but shall not be required to, establish a grantor trust
as a funding source for its obligations under the Plan. If such a trust is so
established, it shall be the intention of the Company that the trust shall
constitute an unfunded arrangement for purposes of the Plan, such that the Plan
shall continue to be an unfunded plan maintained for the purpose of providing
deferred compensation to a select group of management or highly compensated
employees under ERISA. With respect to any Participant, the assets of the trust
so established shall remain subject to the claims of the creditors of that
Participant's Employer in the event of the Employer's bankruptcy or insolvency.

      11.6  CONSTRUCTION. The headings in this Plan have been inserted for
convenience of reference only and are to be ignored in any construction of the
provision.

<PAGE>

      11.7  GENDER AND NUMBER. Except when otherwise clearly indicated by the
context, when used in the Plan words in any gender shall include any other
gender, and words in the singular shall include the plural, and words in the
plural shall include the singular.

      11.8  SEVERABILITY. In the event any provision of the Plan shall be held
invalid or illegal for any reason, any illegality or invalidity shall not affect
the remaining parts of the Plan, but the Plan shall be construed and enforced as
if the illegal or invalid provision had never been inserted, and the Company
shall have the right to correct and remedy such questions of illegality or
invalidity by amendment as provided by the Plan.

      11.9  GOVERNING LAW. The Plan shall be regulated, construed, and
administered in all respects under and by the laws of the state of Ohio, without
regard to its conflict of laws provisions, except when preempted by federal law.

      11.10 VOIDING OF PLAN PROVISIONS. If any provision under this Plan causes
an amount deferred to become subject to income tax under the Code prior to the
time such amount is paid to the Participant, such provision shall be deemed null
and void with respect to such amount deferred and the Administrative Committee
shall take whatever steps as may be required to accomplish the deferral
objectives of the Plan without causing early taxation of such amount deferred
and without any Employer incurring additional cost or liability.

      2002 of the Company's outstanding stock options were not included in the
      diluted net earnings per share calculation because to do so would have
      been antidilutive (i.e., the exercise price exceeded market value).

FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS,

P&G is delivering broad-based, organic growth driven by clear strategies and a
unique combination of P&G strengths. The Company's performance has accelerated
over the past three years, and we are confident double-digit earnings-per-share
growth is sustainable for the foreseeable future.

exchange), 10% or better earnings-per-share growth, and free cash flow equal to
90% or more of net earnings.1 We know we have to earn your trust every year by
meeting or exceeding these goals consistently and reliably.

P&G exceeded all its financial goals in fiscal 2004.

- -     Volume is up 17%. Organic volume is up 10%.(2)

- -     Sales are $51.4 billion, up 19%. Organic sales are up 8%.(3)

- -     Earnings are $6.5 billion, up 25%. Earnings are up 13% versus prior-year
      core earnings.(4)

- -     Earnings per share are $2.32, up 25%. Earnings per share are up 14% versus
      prior-year core earnings per share.

- -     Free Cash Flow is $7.3 billion, or 113% of earnings.

- -     Dividends are up 13%, annualized.

- -     Total Shareholder Return is 24%.

Growth was broad-based. All five Global Business Units delivered at or above the
sales goal; four of five were at or above the earnings goal. Every Market
Development Organization delivered sales and volume growth at or above Company
targets. P&G brands grew share in categories accounting for more than two-thirds
of total Company sales.

This year's results culminate increasingly strong performance over the past
three years. Since July 2001:

- -     P&G cumulative sales have grown 30%. Fiscal 2004 marked the first time in
      P&G history that sales exceeded $50 billion.

- -     Earnings per share have grown over 40%, cumulatively, from core results
      three years ago.(4)

- -     P&G businesses have generated more than $20 billion in cumulative free
      cash flow.

- -     Most important, P&G has delivered a cumulative shareholder return of 81%
      over the past three years, and the price of P&G's stock has increased more
      than 70%. (In fact, over the past four years, cumulative shareholder
      return is above 100%.)

Three years of strong performance is a good start. But we know it's only that -
a start. Necessary, but not sufficient. It's consistent long-term performance
that counts, and consistent performance is not easy. Growing P&G sales 4% - 6%
per year, for example, is the equivalent of adding a business the size of P&G's
total business in the U.K. or a brand the size of Tide - every year.

The challenge is significant, and we don't take it lightly, but I'm confident
P&G can reliably deliver the balanced, consistent growth to which we've
committed. There are three reasons for my confidence:

1. P&G strategies are working, and there is still considerable room for growth.

2. P&G strengths give us the ability to respond to major external trends and
challenges.

3. Systemic and structural changes implemented over the past several years are
improving the consistency and reliability of P&G performance.

When combined with the strength of P&G's culture and P&G people, these three
factors make P&G a better investment proposition today than we have been in many
years.

GROWTH STRATEGIES ARE WORKING

In my 2001 Letter to Shareholders, I outlined five growth

                                                                               3

strategies. We've executed well over the last three years. Every strategy is
delivering, and there's plenty of room for additional growth.

1. Build existing core businesses into stronger global leaders P&G's core
businesses are Baby Care, Fabric Care, Feminine Care and Hair Care. These are
categories in which P&G is #1 in global sales and #1 in global market share.
Together, they generate more than half of the Company's total profits. Most
important, they are categories in which we believe we can maintain and extend
P&G leadership.

In fact, over the past three years, we have steadily expanded P&G's share in all
these businesses. Baby Care now has a 36% global share - an increase of nearly
four percentage points over the past three years. P&G's 35% share of global
Feminine Care is up more than two percentage points in three years. We have a
31% share of global Fabric Care, and a 20% share of global Hair Care, each up
one point or more in three years. For perspective, a one-percentage-point
increase in market share across these four core businesses is worth about $1
billion in annual sales and more than $150 million in annual earnings.

2. Grow leading brands, big countries, winning customers

I explained in 2001 that we intended to grow sales, market shares and profits -
at rates above total Company targets - on our leading brands, in our biggest
markets, in growing distribution channels, at winning retailers. Again, we've
delivered and continue to build momentum.

P&G now has 16 billion-dollar brands, up from 10 just four years ago. One of
these, Pampers, is a $5 billion brand. Another, Tide, is a $3 billion brand. And
two others, Pantene and Ariel, are $2 billion brands. Eight of these
billion-dollar brands are leaders in their category or segment. The portfolio of
billion-dollar brands delivered compounded annual sales and profit growth of 7%
and 16%, respectively, over the past three years.

Ten more P&G brands have sales between $500 million and $1 billion - with
credible potential to pass the billion-dollar mark in the years ahead. We don't
push brands to cross the billion-dollar line. They must have clear strategies to
achieve and sustain the growth, a brand equity grounded in deep consumer insight
and a solid innovation pipeline. But, as P&G brands join the billion-dollar
club, the Company takes important steps toward the strategic goal of having
global category leadership and the #1 global brand in every major category in
which we compete.

All top 10 countries grew volume and sales. Over the past three years, we've
demonstrated we can keep growing clear-cut leadership positions in core markets
by being closer to consumers and customers, leading innovation, delivering
superior value and building stronger local organizations. For example, in the
U.S., P&G Feminine Care has added seven percentage points to its share
leadership margin, and now has a 22-share-point advantage versus the next-best
competitor. In the U.K., Baby Care has added nearly 13 points to its share
leadership margin, and now has a 28-share-point advantage over the #2
competitor.

P&G is growing volume and share at 9 of our top 10 retail customers. Our
strategy is to develop highly collaborative partnerships with customers so we
both win when consumers choose where to shop and what to buy. We do this by
leveraging P&G strengths in shopper understanding, innovation that drives
category growth and supply chain efficiency.

3. Develop faster-growing, higher-margin, more asset-efficient businesses with
global leadership potential

Health Care and Beauty Care businesses now represent

<PAGE>

4

nearly half of Company sales and profits. Since July 2001, we've delivered
double-digit compounded annual growth across the following Health Care and
Beauty Care businesses:

- -     Skin Care sales are up 17% behind a strong initiative pipeline, including
      Olay Total Effects, Olay Daily Facials and Olay Regenerist.

- -     Hair Care sales are up 19% as we've strengthened global brands such as
      Pantene and Head & Shoulders and as we've added new brands like Clairol
      Herbal Essences.

- -     Oral Care sales are up 18% on the strength of a solid-base dentifrice
      business and fast-growing new segments led by Crest Whitestrips, Crest
      Night Effects and Crest SpinBrush.

- -     Pharmaceutical sales are up 26% and the business has become profitable -
      led by Actonel, which has grown about 90% a year over the three-year
      period. Actonel became a billion-dollar brand faster than any other brand
      in P&G history.

- -     Personal Health Care sales are up 15%, led most recently by Prilosec OTC,
      which achieved market leadership within five days of launch and continued
      to grow to its current 26% share of the heartburn remedy category.

In addition, profits in all of these Health Care and Beauty Care categories are
up double-digits.

4. Regain growth momentum and leadership in Western Europe

We have turned around this critical business - one of the largest consumer
markets in the world. Growth has been broad-based. Share is presently growing in
categories representing about 80% of Western Europe sales. Baby Care and
Feminine Care shares are now 50%. Laundry share is 30%. Shampoo, Feminine Care
and Home Care shares are at all-time highs.

5. Drive growth in key developing markets

Developing markets now account for about 20% of P&G sales. P&G volume in key
markets such as China and Russia has more than doubled in the past three years,
significantly outpacing market growth. In China, P&G's Laundry and Oral Care
market shares have all more than doubled in the past three years. And in Russia
over the past three years, Laundry, Hair Care and Oral Care - all category
leaders - have each earned at least five additional share points.

CONSISTENT PERFORMANCE

Three years of strong performance is a good start, but it's long term
performance that counts. Consistent performance is not easy. Growing P&G sales
4%-6% per year is roughly the equivalent of adding a brand the size of Tide -
every year.

ROOM TO GROW

These highlights demonstrate that P&G strategies are working. What's most
important, however, is that there's plenty of room to keep growing.

Global market shares in core categories - those where P&G is already the global
leader - are in the range of only 20% - 36%. In our most successful markets, we
have shares that are nearly twice the level of our current global shares. As a
result, we believe we can continue to expand P&G's market-share leadership in
these important categories.

We're also optimistic that we can keep growing in big countries. For example,
while we've restored much of P&G's leadership in Western Europe, we are still
not back to peak share levels in several categories, such as Diapers and
Laundry. Further, we are substantially underdeveloped in health and beauty. In
Dentifrice, we have only a 13% share in Western Europe, versus a 32% share in
North America. In Hair Care, we have an 18% share in Western Europe, but this is
still 16 share points lower than in North America. We are committed to reaching
best-in-class share levels in all major Western Europe categories.

With a strong core business that we will keep strong, we're now in a position to
begin pushing out from that core into new markets, new channels, new customer
segments and new businesses.

Beauty Care is a good example. P&G has about a 10% share of the nearly $170
billion global beauty market. With billion-

<PAGE>

                                                                               5

dollar beauty brands and new capabilities added by Clairol and Wella, we are
well positioned for strong growth.

In Health Care, we have strong, growing franchises in Crest, Iams and Prilosec
OTC. We've only scratched the surface with Actonel, our first billion-dollar
pharmaceutical brand, and we're optimistic about our pipeline, particularly
Intrinsa, our female testosterone patch.

Home Care is another faster-growing, higher-margin growth opportunity. We have
more than doubled P&G's Home Care business in the past three years. Still, P&G
is a significant player in categories representing less than half of the total
home care market.

Developing markets, with 80% of the world's population, are another opportunity.
P&G's organic volume in these markets is growing more than 50% faster than in
developed markets. As we build leadership scale, we believe we can grow
developing markets to a third of P&G sales.

There are also important sources of continued bottom-line improvement. Global
Business Services, for example, has locked-in substantial guaranteed savings
over the next four fiscal years - and is expecting additional purchasing savings
over the same period. In addition, the shift in our portfolio toward Health Care
and Beauty Care has added almost three percentage points to the Company's gross
margin over the past five years. We expect the more balanced portfolio to
continue improving gross margins in the years ahead.

The key point is that P&G strategies are working, and there is plenty of room
left to grow. We are committed to keep leading product innovation in our
categories; nothing is more central to sustained growth than category-leading
innovation. We are equally committed to continued innovation in marketing and
sales, as well as other areas of the business. And we are focused on getting the
most from dedicated business units, global scale and the strength of our growth
businesses to capture the significant opportunities still ahead of us.

SOURCES OF CONFIDENCE

We're confident P&G can reliably deliver the future growth to which we've
committed. Our strategies are working. There still is room to grow. Our
strengths enable us to respond to external trends and challenges. Major changes
are improving the consistency of P&G performance.

CHALLENGES PLAY TO P&G STRENGTHS

While our business is strong, and future prospects are bright, there are clearly
challenges we must acknowledge and manage.

First, there are business issues we need to address in the near-term. Family
Care and Coffee categories have experienced considerable price competition and
commodity cost pressure. Hair Colorants faces heavy competitive activity. To
become a leader in Colorants, we need an even more competitive cost structure;
we need to lead innovation; and we need to build even stronger brand equities.
We recognize these issues and are taking decisive steps to address them.

There are also the ever-present risks of complacency and complexity. When times
are good, it's easy to lose focus, to lose touch with consumers and customers,
to let costs rise. We recognize this, and are committed to keeping P&G
businesses simple and focused like a laser on delivering superior consumer value
and better customer service.

Competitive pressure, of course, is an unrelenting challenge. We compete against
some of the best companies in the world, and they are not standing still. They
are responding to P&G share growth with their own initiatives. Branded
competition, as well as retailer brands in a variety of formats, present a
constant challenge to lead innovation and offer superior value.

Another challenge is rising commodity costs. Where possible, we recover these
costs via pricing. When we cannot fully price to recover higher costs, we must
find offsetting cost savings elsewhere. We cannot permit

<PAGE>

rising costs to erode the consumer value of P&G brands, particularly as brand
choices and consumer expectations for value continue to grow.

Media fragmentation is yet another challenge. Today, the average U.S. household
has access to 90 television channels, up from 27 channels a decade ago.
Prime-time audience share for the big three U.S. networks has dropped 23
percentage points over the same period. The reality is that there is less "mass"
in mass media today. We have to develop capabilities to communicate with
consumers when, where and how they choose. We must be as innovative in marketing
as we are in product design and development.

Global economic and political disruptions are also a continuing risk. Our
diversified portfolio and geographic breadth provide significant shock
absorption, but we must always closely monitor these situations so we can
respond fast when crises occur - as we did in Latin America in 2003.

These are significant challenges. We believe, however, that P&G's strengths in
branding, innovation, go-to-market capability and scale will help ensure that
these challenges do not prevent us from delivering reliable, consistent growth.

- -     In a world of abundant consumer choice and retail consolidation, branding
      becomes more important than ever. P&G's proven ability to understand
      consumers and build billion-dollar brands that consumers love and
      retailers find indispensable can be an increasing source of advantage.

- -     In an environment of rising consumer expectations, relentless competition
      and rapid technological change, innovation becomes more important than
      ever. P&G is setting the pace of innovation in its major businesses today,
      and improving its innovation success rate. We are also thinking more
      broadly about what innovation is, where it comes from, who is responsible
      for it and how it can be commercialized. We're connecting externally with
      a global network of innovation partners and strengthening internal
      capabilities in design and marketing innovation.

- -     In a marketplace that is simultaneously global and local, P&G's
      go-to-market strengths and scale advantages are increasingly important. We
      have the ability to reap the benefits of a $50 billion global company
      while understanding and responding to needs in individual local markets.

P&G has a history of leading change. Our willingness to deal realistically with
change and our proven ability to turn change - and the challenges it presents -
to advantage are important sources of my confidence in P&G's future.

P&G'S GROWTH STRATEGY

Build existing core business into strong global leaders.

[GRAPHICS]

Grow leading brands in big countries with winning customers. Accelerate growth
in Western Europe.

SYSTEMIC AND STRUCTURAL CHANGES ARE IMPROVING PERFORMANCE

I am also confident P&G can sustain growth because several systemic and
structural changes implemented over the past few years are improving the
consistency and reliability of P&G performance. Four changes in particular are
enabling more consistent growth and are creating competitive advantage: a more
balanced business portfolio, greater ability to serve lower-income consumers, a
unique organization structure, and strong cash and cost control.

A Balanced Portfolio Creates Flexibility

We have moved toward a more balanced mix of household businesses and health and
beauty businesses. Longer term, this more balanced portfolio will help us
sustain strong revenue growth, absorb inevitable short-term "bumps in the road,"
and deliver more balanced, consistent, predictable profit growth.

<PAGE>

                                                                               7

P&G's foundation is household products. These are large businesses that are
growing steadily and reliably generate earnings and cash. Overall Company
performance has been driven by these foundation categories for generations. We
grew P&G sales eightfold in the 1970s and 1980s when virtually all our business
was in household categories. Our enthusiasm and expectations for these household
businesses have not diminished. We remain the global leader in many of these
businesses, and are growing fast in categories such as Home Care.

Health Care and Beauty Care are faster-growing, higher-margin businesses in
which P&G is emerging as a global leader. We expect both Health and Beauty to be
disproportionate engines of growth in the first decade of the 21st century.
These businesses are appealing because they're huge markets - the beauty market
is more than four times the size of the fabric care market, for example - with
no dominant leaders. P&G shares are low, and we're developing the capabilities
to grow rapidly.

We will keep our foundation healthy and growing while we build momentum in these
newer businesses. Our near-term goal is to break out as a clear global leader in
Beauty and to continue building Health Care at a fast rate. This makes P&G a
unique investment proposition. We have strong healthy household businesses -
anchored by leading, billion-dollar brands like Pampers, Ariel and Downy that
are growing at rates above industry averages. We also have faster-growing,
higher-margin health and beauty businesses that are growing ahead of both
industry averages and P&G target growth rates. No other consumer products
company offers this unique portfolio balance.

[GRAPHICS]

Accelerate growth in developing markets and with lower-income consumers.

Serving More Consumers Drives Growth

We are building capability to serve lower-income consumers who are not buying
and using P&G products on a regular basis today.

There are major unserved and underserved populations in every market where P&G
competes. The opportunity is greatest in developing markets. The risk, however,
is greater, too. The key is to be selective, focused and disciplined. We have
made clear choices about where we will focus P&G investments and efforts, and
are executing plans in ways that minimize risks.

This approach is working in big developing markets such as China, Russia and
Mexico. In China, for example, we entered the market in 1988. Our first
categories were Shampoo, Skin Care and Personal Cleansing. We became market
leaders in these categories, and developed distribution and supply chains to
reach China's largest cities. In the mid-1990s, we entered Fabric Care, Feminine
Care and Oral Care. Then, we entered Baby Care in the late 1990s.

We accelerated entry into these categories by using the distribution and supply
chains we'd built earlier, and we leveraged P&G's branding and innovation
strengths to win with consumers. We've doubled the size of P&G's China business
over the past three years. We're now expanding these categories by innovating to
the needs of more Chinese consumers. In 2001, P&G brands were focused on
premium-tier consumers. The premium tier made up about 16% of the market in the
categories where we competed. Today, we've expanded our product offerings to
mid-tier consumers and are reaching more than 50% of the market. There still is
room to grow, and we remain optimistic about P&G's potential in China.

A Unique Organization Structure Creates Advantage

I explained in my 2002 Letter to Shareholders that P&G had moved to a new
operating structure. We organized around Global Business Units (GBUs), Market
Development Organizations (MDOs), a Global Business Services organization (GBS)
and Corporate Functions. We're now

<PAGE>

8

able to capture the benefits of focused, smaller companies through dedicated
GBUs while capturing the go-to-market strengths and capabilities of a $50
billion company through local market development organizations, the shared
business services organization and lean corporate functions that ensure P&G's
functional disciplines continue to lead the industry.

Global Business Units are able to develop clearer, better long-term growth
strategies for P&G brands. They identify common consumer needs and quickly
expand brands and product innovations to different markets around the world.
They are aligned behind Total Shareholder Return metrics and are focused
exclusively on leadership in their individual industries.

Other companies have this single-minded strategic business-unit focus, but P&G
has two additional advantages that play to our unique combination of strengths:
Market Development Organizations and Global Business Services.

The MDO teams know local markets: people, retailers, supply chains and local
governments. They have a broader portfolio of brands to meet a wider range of
specific needs for local consumers and customers. They are aligned behind
top-line growth, market share, cash, cost and value-creation objectives, and are
focused exclusively on winning in local markets.

The key advantage of our structure is that the MDOs can focus 100% of their
resources on local consumers and customers without duplicating product
innovation, product sourcing, brand advertising or other activities that are now
led by the Global Business Units. We have eliminated inefficient overlaps and,
as a result, freed up resources to collaborate better with customers and focus
exclusively on winning in local markets.

In addition, there is an intangible but important benefit that comes from P&G's
"promote from within" culture. The men and women working in the GBUs and MDOs
often know each other because they've spent their entire careers at P&G. They're
focused on the same purpose. They have similar values. They've had similar
career experiences. This strengthens their ability to debate issues, make
decisions and execute with excellence.

The third advantage of P&G's structure is Global Business Services, which
delivers better service and better technology at best-in-class costs to P&G
businesses. Very few other companies in any industry have global business
services capability that rivals P&G's for quality, innovation, cost and scale.

Multiply these benefits across categories, markets and trade channels, and you
can see the scale advantages available to P&G:

- -     We can compete on multiple fronts simultaneously without spreading
      ourselves too thin.

- -     We can deliver a higher frequency of new products across multiple markets.

- -     We can plan long term globally while focusing locally on superior
      execution every day.

In short, we can reap the benefits of global scale while acting like a local
company everywhere we compete. P&G now has sufficient experience with the new
structure to begin taking fuller advantage of the benefits it creates.

EARNING YOUR TRUST

P&G strategies, strengths, and the systemic and structural changes we've made to
improve the reliability of our performance should give shareholders confidence
that P&G can sustain double-digit earnings-per-share growth for the foreseeable
future.

Focus on Cost and Cash Is Keeping P&G Brands Competitive

The final change I want to highlight is the degree to which cash and cost
discipline is now ingrained in the organization. We're driving a cost-reduction
and cash-improvement mindset deeper into the Company with clearer reporting
structures, clearer accountability and the disciplined use of Total Shareholder
Return at the business unit level.

<PAGE>

                                                                               9

P&G's approach to Research and Development is a good example. Historically,
systems for evaluating R&D were strongly linked to technical product
performance. There was a heavy focus on patents and internally generated
innovation. There was less focus on perceived consumer value, on the
cost/benefit trade-off for consumers versus competition, and on fast, successful
commercialization.

In the new structure, R&D leaders are more effectively integrated into the
global business units. There's greater emphasis on winning when consumers
compare brands for overall value. We're integrating commercial and technical
innovation more seamlessly, and we're leveraging the Company's "connect and
develop" capability to build even stronger relationships with external
innovation partners for increased speed to market.

We're accelerating the pace of innovation and increasing the efficiency of R&D
investments. We've doubled P&G's innovation success rate. Our portfolio of
initiatives launched in the last calendar year is on track to deliver more than
100% of going-in expectations. At the same time, R&D investment as a percent of
sales is down from 4.5% of net sales three years ago to 3.5% of net sales this
past fiscal year. P&G R&D is now much more effective and efficient.

The focus on rigorous cost control and cash management ensures consumer value
that keeps P&G brands competitive worldwide.

STRENGTH OF P&G PEOPLE

It's been genuinely inspiring to watch the way P&G people have responded to the
Company's challenges over the past four years. In the end, P&G people - their
values and capabilities, commitment and dedication to excellence - are the best
guarantee of consistent, reliable growth.

EARNING YOUR TRUST

The three factors I've outlined - strategies that are working, strengths that
enable us to deal effectively with challenges and trends, systemic and
structural changes that are improving the reliability of P&G performance -
convince me that P&G can sustain double-digit earnings-per-share growth for the
foreseeable future, particularly when combined with the capability and
commitment of P&G people.

It's almost a cliche in CEO letters to shareholders to credit employees as a
company's greatest asset. It's far more than a cliche at P&G. There is no
greater evidence of this than the performance of P&G people over the past four
years. We committed ourselves at the beginning of this decade to get P&G back on
track and to ensure that P&G is and is seen as one of the world's great
companies. In many companies, a crisis like the one P&G faced in the spring and
summer of 2000 could have sent people running for the doors. Not here. P&G
people are proud of their company, and they refused to let P&G be anything other
than the industry leader we've always been. They dealt with the reality of what
we were up against and set about the hard work of fixing problems, creating and
seizing opportunities, and getting P&G back in the lead. It's been genuinely
inspiring to watch and be part of this tremendous employee response.

Ultimately, this is the reason P&G is where it is today. P&G strategies provide
clear direction. P&G systems and structure leverage P&G strengths. But it's P&G
people who are the best guarantee of consistent, reliable growth. It's P&G
people who create and execute strategies, who get to know consumers and create
the innovations that delight them, who work side-by-side with customers and
business partners. It's P&G people whose individual efforts ultimately deliver
the returns we provide to you, as shareholders. In the end, you place your trust
in P&G people. And, we work hard to earn your trust by delivering consistent,
reliable sales and earnings growth year after year.

BALANCED ORGANIZATION

We rebalanced and refocused our Global Business Units to create units of about
the same size. Beauty Care, Household Care, and Health, Baby and Family Care are
each about $17 billion in sales. Individually, each would rank within the top
115 companies in the Fortune 500.(R)

ORGANIZATION/MANAGEMENT CHANGES

In July 2004, we realigned P&G's business units and made associated management
changes. The realignments streamline our business operations to support further
growth. They affect organization alignment only (they will not result in any
special charges). P&G retains its unique Global Business Unit/Market Development
Organization/Global Business Services structure. It is building businesses and
delivering competitive advantage.

We're implementing these changes as several senior P&G leaders prepare to
retire. We owe these leaders a great debt of gratitude. They have made lasting
contributions to accelerating P&G's growth and building strong organizations.
We'll tap their experience in their remaining months with the Company to ensure
a smooth transition to the next generation of P&G leaders:

Why are we realigning the business units? Our Beauty and Health Care businesses
have grown dramatically. As the size of key businesses changed with acquisitions
and divestitures, it became clear we needed to rebalance and refocus our Global
Business Units to create units of about the same size. Beauty Care, Household
Care, and Health, Baby and Family Care are each about $17 billion in sales.
Individually, each would rank within the top 115 companies in the Fortune
500.(R)

We also re-titled the combination of our Market Development Organizations,
Global Business Services and other business functions into one new unit called
Global Operations.

The four business units are led by vice chairmen:

- -     SUSAN ARNOLD is Vice Chairman - Global Beauty Care. Susan was previously
      the president - Global Personal Beauty Care and Global Feminine Care.

- -     BRUCE BYRNES is Vice Chairman of the Board - Global Household Care. Bruce
      was previously vice chairman of the board and president - Global Beauty
      and Feminine Care and Global Health Care.

- -     KERRY CLARK is Vice Chairman of the Board - Global Health, Baby and Family
      Care. Kerry was previously vice chairman of the board and president -
      Global Market Development and Business Operations.

- -     BOB MCDONALD is Vice Chairman - Global Operations. Bob was previously the
      president - Global Fabric and Home Care.

These vice chairmen and the other senior managers - line presidents and global
staff officers - provide us with an extremely strong, collaborative leadership
team. Few companies can match the diversity and breadth of their total
experience. The changes build on our successful organization structure, and
maintain significant continuity of leadership to drive further growth.

P&G'S BILLION-DOLLAR BRANDS

P&G added three billion-dollar brands this year: Actonel, Head & Shoulders and
the Wella family of Professional and Retail Hair Care products. P&G has 16
brands with over one billion dollars in sales - up from 10 billion-dollar brands
four years ago. Together, these 16 brands generate about $30 billion in annual
sales.

FISCAL YEAR 2004 RESULTS

The Fabric and Home Care business unit delivered another year of solid results.
Volume increased 9%, sales grew 10% and net earnings grew 7%. The growth in
fiscal 2004 came from strengthening leadership positions in existing categories,
growing rapidly in developing markets and with lower-income consumers, and
launching and leveraging new products that have created entirely new categories.
In addition, we supported this exceptional top-line growth with increased
investments in marketing and supply systems.

P&G grew its leadership share in the mature Fabric Care market to more than 31%
of this $40 billion category. Innovations like Tide Clean White in China, Downy
One Rinse in Latin America and Gain Fabric Enhancer in North America are great
examples of new products that helped Fabric Care grow market share globally.

In addition, Home Care products such as Swiffer, Febreze, Mr. Clean Magic Eraser
and Mr. Clean AutoDry Carwash have created entirely new product categories for
P&G and our customers. These products led P&G Home Care to 12% unit volume
growth.

WHAT'S WORKING

P&G's Fabric and Home Care business has accelerated pro?table market share and
sales growth by improving fundamentals, strengthening innovation and developing
low-cost activity systems to reach more consumers more profitably. Our business
fundamentals are sound. Nearly all of our products test superior to the best
competitive products and are supported by business-building marketing and
advertising programs.

We have more than doubled our innovation success rate and more than doubled the
future value potential of the innovations in our pipeline. Importantly, we are
introducing new-to-the-world products that are making consumers' lives easier
and building business for our trade customers.

We are satisfying more lower-income consumers with unique product designs and
marketing programs. We are building unique activity systems that integrate
product design, manufacturing supply chain and customer distribution systems to
keep our costs competitive with local, low-cost competition. The Tide Clean
White initiative is an excellent example of a locally tailored product using a
low-cost activity system to significantly grow our share in China.

Over the past year we have profitably built global market share in all of our
categories (detergents, fabric conditioners, dishwashing and surface care), and
we begin ?scal year 2005 with strong momentum and a full innovation pipeline.
Fabric and Home Care continues to be an important engine of growth for P&G.

FISCAL YEAR 2004 RESULTS

The Beauty Care business unit delivered excellent results in fiscal 2004. Unit
volume increased 37%, sales grew 40% and net earnings increased 22%. This
excellent performance was driven by a combination of double-digit organic growth
and the acquisition of Wella. Wella joined P&G Beauty Care in September 2003 and
added approximately $3.3 billion to Beauty Care sales in fiscal 2004.

Beauty Care's organic growth was led by brands that have been favorites of
consumers for many years. Head & Shoulders delivered 18% global volume growth
and became P&G Beauty Care's fifth billion-dollar brand, joining Pantene,
Always, Olay and Wella. Pantene passed the $2 billion sales mark and
strengthened its position as the world's leading hair care brand. Olay grew
global sales 26% with new innovations like Regenerist and continued growth of
the Total Effects and Daily Facials product lines. Always feminine care products
grew global volume double-digits and Tampax Pearl has helped grow the brand to
over 46% of the U.S. tampon market. Lacoste, with annual volume up nearly 400%
in just two years, has helped make P&G a global leader in men's fine fragrances.

WHAT'S WORKING

Leadership innovation and holistic marketing programs are the cornerstones of
P&G Beauty's growth strategy. We are continuously improving the performance of
our existing products and launching new products to meet previously unmet
consumer needs. Products like Olay Total Effects, with our proprietary
VitaNiacin ingredient, established Olay as the leader in anti-aging skin care.
We then followed with Olay Regenerist - developed from wound-healing science and
marketed to Olay skin care's most demanding consumers as an anti-aging
alternative to cosmetic medical procedures. Next, we built upon the success of
Regenerist in the U.S. and expanded it to delight consumers in all corners of
the world. Priced at the top end of mass market skin care products, Regenerist
is driving outstanding growth in China and Southeast Asia.

In addition, Beauty Care is successfully complementing innovation with
acquisitions. In 2001, the Clairol acquisition moved P&G into the growing hair
colorants category. In 2003, the addition of Wella connected P&G to the cutting
edge of hair trends - the professional hair care market. Both acquisitions have
expanded P&G's Beauty portfolio, added world-class brands and strengthened P&G's
capabilities to win long term in Beauty Care.

Beauty Care is an attractive market. It has high margins, low capital intensity
and is growing worldwide at a pace well ahead of population growth. Combined
with P&G's historical capabilities in building leadership brands and leveraging
scale for low costs, Beauty Care should be a growth leader for P&G for many
years to come.

FISCAL YEAR 2004 RESULTS

Baby and Family Care delivered another strong year of volume, sales and profit
growth. Unit volume grew 6%, net sales grew 8% and net earnings increased 13%.

The Baby Care business continued its strong global growth, increasing unit
volume double-digits and growing global market share. Western Europe and Latin
America led the way. Western Europe grew baby care market share to 50%, a
five-year high, and Latin America grew diaper volume by almost 30%. In the U.S.,
Pampers delivered mid-single-digit volume growth behind continuing leverage of
the Baby Stages of Development and Baby Dry product lines.

Family Care delivered modest volume growth in a difficult competitive
environment. Despite competitive marketing spending increases and new product
launches, Charmin and Bounty maintained market share and product performance
leadership versus key competitors. Both brands announced price increases
effective in July 2004 to partially offset rising commodity costs. The business
is well positioned for profit growth in line with company targets in fiscal
2005.

WHAT'S WORKING

The strong results delivered by Baby and Family Care are a direct outcome of
delighting consumers with better performing products that represent good value
for the money, and a relentless focus on cost reduction and cash generation. We
have strengthened all elements of our innovation system - better understanding
consumers' desires, reducing innovation costs and lead times, and creating
holistic marketing plans that resonate at every consumer touch point.

We are designing new products, such as Pampers Basica in Latin America, that are
tailored to meet the unique product performance and affordability needs of
lower-income consumers. Pampers diaper volume has grown double-digits in each
Latin American market since the Basica launch. We have increased market share in
Western Europe by continuing to leverage our Baby Stages of Development and Baby
Dry diaper lines and by rapidly growing our Kandoo toddler personal care
business.

Our investment in Baby Care's standardized manufacturing platform is paying off
as we better leverage our scale for cost savings and faster speed to market with
new products. We are improving manufacturing productivity, which helps reduce
the capital investment necessary to meet increased consumer demand. We
introduced our softest, strongest, thickest Charmin ever last year and
simultaneously increased capacity and lowered costs. Cost-savings efforts have
allowed us to maintain sharp consumer value, invest behind new products with
strong marketing programs, offset rising commodity costs, and improve profit
margins and cash generation - all of which are critical to delivering superior
shareholder returns.

FISCAL YEAR 2004 RESULTS

The Health Care business unit delivered its fifth consecutive year of strong
double-digit growth in volume, sales and profit. Volume increased 18%, sales
grew 21% and net earnings increased 36% behind outstanding new product
innovations and improving profit margins.

All of the Health Care business segments delivered great results in fiscal 2004.
Actonel led the growth in Pharmaceuticals, building global value share in the
fast-growing osteoporosis treatment category to become a billion-dollar brand.
Personal Health Care growth was fueled by the launch of Prilosec OTC for the
treatment of frequent heartburn. Prilosec OTC is widely regarded as one of the
most successful over-the-counter health care launches ever. The Crest brand
became the clear Oral Care market leader in the U.S. Crest Whitening Expressions
and Vivid White drove share in the U.S. toothpaste segment to over 33%, and
Crest Whitestrips Premium drove U.S. tooth whitening share to over 70%. Iams
continued to deliver steady growth, posting its fifth consecutive year of U.S.
market share increases. Iams is now the #1 pet nutrition brand in the U.S.

WHAT'S WORKING

P&G's Health Care business continues to be driven by a powerful combination of
breakthrough innovation, strategic acquisitions and alliances, and operating
cost discipline. In the last four years alone, new health care innovations have
contributed more than $1.5 billion in incremental sales. This growth comes from
a strict application of P&G's "launch and leverage" approach.

First, Health Care develops and launches outstanding new products with holistic
introductory marketing plans and excellent in-store execution. Prilosec OTC is
an excellent example of P&G's initiative launch capabilities.

Second, we leverage these new products with strong marketing support and product
improvements for several years after initial launch. Two great examples of this
"launch and leverage" approach are Crest Whitestrips and Actonel, which have
continued to deliver strong sales growth in their third and fourth years in the
market, respectively.

The acquisition of Crest SpinBrush in 2001 and Glide Floss last year have helped
make P&G a leading player in all major segments of the oral care market.
Upstream development alliances with pharmaceutical companies have helped us
develop a full pipeline of life-enhancing drugs that are at various stages of
testing. And while we invest to support new product launches and research to
develop tomorrow's breakthrough new products, we are in tight control of
operating costs. Only with strict cost control can we deliver new products at a
great value for consumers while still delivering an excellent return for our
shareholders.

FISCAL YEAR 2004 RESULTS

Snacks and Beverages delivered strong profit growth in a difficult competitive
environment. Volume increased 4%, sales grew 8% and net earnings increased 19%
versus the prior year.

New products like Pringles Dippers, Pringles Prints and the Folgers AromaSeal
package upgrade have kept P&G in the innovation lead. These initiatives also
helped Snacks and Beverages post mid-single-digit unit volume growth for fiscal
year 2004.

Folgers faced both rising coffee bean prices and heavy competitive promotional
spending for much of the fiscal year. Despite these challenges, Folgers
increased its leadership market share in the U.S. to 32%.

Pringles posted high-single-digit global volume growth for the year, led by
North America and Western Europe, which both grew double-digits.

WHAT'S WORKING

P&G's Snacks and Beverages business is focused on continuing to strengthen the
consumer appeal of its billion-dollar brands - Folgers and Pringles. This starts
with leadership innovation. For Pringles, it is products like Prints, Dippers
and customer-specific customization initiatives. For Folgers, it is products
like the AromaSeal canister initiative and the Home Cafe system. These
breakthroughs are being delivered on top of an ongoing stream of new flavors
that continue to attract new consumers to these leading brands.

In addition to delivering leadership innovation, Pringles and Folgers are
relentless at driving out non-value-added costs and improving capacity
utilization. This strict cost focus is critical to maintaining superior consumer
value. Profit margins for the segment have improved from 7% in fiscal 2001 to
over 10% for fiscal 2004.

Much of the margin improvement has come from detailed cost-reduction programs
and asset-utilization improvements on Pringles. Pringles and Folgers have very
scale-driven cost structures, and we are leveraging the scale of these
billion-dollar brands better than we have for many years.

Enhancing the consumer appeal of the brands and maintaining excellent consumer
value is our simple recipe to keep Folgers and Pringles delighting consumers and
delivering strong shareholder returns for many years to come.

MARKET DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION (MDO)

FISCAL YEAR 2004 RESULTS

The MDO is focused solely on winning the "First Moment of Truth" - when the
consumer is shopping in the store. Our MDO professionals are on the ground in
over 80 countries, and we have about 50 dedicated teams working directly with
customers around the world. Their challenge is to be the experts at
understanding local consumers and customers, and to use this knowledge to build
customized business plans for our brands.

This clear focus again delivered great results. In fiscal year 2004, P&G's
global volume growth was 17%, including the impact of the Wella acquisition.
Organic volume growth, excluding acquisition and divestiture impacts, was 10%
for the year, and each of P&G's market development regions delivered organic
volume growth of 6% or higher. Developing markets, which accounted for about 20%
of P&G's sales in fiscal 2004, grew volume by nearly 20% versus the previous
year.

The growth strength was also broad-based across P&G's biggest brands, countries
and customers. P&G grew volume at 9 of our top 10 customers, on all of our top
10 global brands, and in all of our top 10 countries. This established a solid
foundation to grow P&G's smaller brands and markets. In fact, the balance of our
top brands, countries and customers each grew volume at a double-digit rate -
truly outstanding performance.

WHAT'S WORKING

The MDO is developing new capabilities that are making us better and stronger
than ever before - allowing P&G to win the First Moment of Truth more often. We
are:

- -     partnering with winning retailers to jointly create value through better
      understanding shopper habits, providing solutions that meet the retailers'
      marketing strategies and driving out non-value-added costs;

- -     improving the availability of our products on store shelves with supply
      system innovations that reduce out-of-stocks while reducing costs and
      inventories for P&G and retailers;

- -     reaching more of the world's consumers by broadening the distribution of
      our brands through new channels in developed markets and increasing
      penetration of smaller stores in developing markets;

- -     ensuring that our brands are priced to provide excellent consumer value by
      closely monitoring our pricing strategy versus all competitors, including
      private labels, and acting quickly to keep our flagship brands priced
      right;

- -     improving the in-store presence of P&G brands through better packaging,
      shelf layouts and unique customer merchandising events;

- -     improving the impact and success rate of P&G initiatives through holistic
      in-store marketing and local media relations programs.

After only five years in our new organization structure, we have made good
progress building our skills to better market to shoppers and jointly create
value with retailers. However, true to P&G's culture, we are never satisfied and
will keep building on this foundation to ensure the MDO is a sustainable
competitive advantage that will continue to get stronger.

18 The Procter & Gamble Company and Subsidiaries

MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING

Procter & Gamble has been built through the generations by the character of its
people. That character is reflected in our Purpose, Values and Principles and in
how well we live them as individuals and as a Company. High quality financial
reporting is one of our responsibilities - one that we execute with integrity.

High quality financial reporting is characterized by accuracy, objectivity and
transparency. Management is responsible for maintaining an effective system of
internal controls over financial reporting to deliver those characteristics in
all material respects. The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee,
provides oversight. They have engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP to audit our
consolidated financial statements, on which they have issued an unqualified
opinion.

Our commitment to providing timely, accurate and understandable information to
investors encompasses:

Communicating expectations to employees. Key employee responsibilities are
reinforced through the Company's "Worldwide Business Conduct Manual," which sets
forth the Company's commitment to conduct its business affairs with high ethical
standards. Every one of P&G's employees - from senior management on down - is
held personally accountable for compliance. The Worldwide Business Conduct
Manual is available on our website at www.pg.com.

Maintaining a strong internal control environment. Our system of internal
controls includes written policies and procedures, segregation of duties and the
careful selection and development of employees. The system is designed to
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are executed as authorized and
appropriately recorded, that assets are safeguarded and that accounting records
are sufficiently reliable to permit the preparation of financial statements that
conform in all material respects with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. We monitor these internal controls through
control self-assessments by business unit management and an ongoing program of
internal audits around the world.

Executing financial stewardship. We maintain specific programs and activities to
ensure that employees understand their fiduciary responsibilities to
shareholders. This ongoing effort encompasses financial discipline in our
strategic and daily business decisions and brings particular focus to
maintaining accurate financial reporting and effective controls through process
improvement, skill development and oversight.

Exerting rigorous oversight of the business. We continuously review our business
results and strategic choices. Our Global Leadership Council is actively
involved - from understanding strategies to reviewing key initiatives, financial
performance and control assessments. The intent is to ensure we remain objective
in our assessments, constructively challenge the approach to business
opportunities, identify potential issues and ensure reward and recognition
systems are appropriately aligned with results.

Engaging our Disclosure Committee. We maintain disclosure controls and
procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported timely and accurately. Our
Disclosure Committee is a group of senior-level executives responsible for
evaluating disclosure implications of significant business activities and
events. The Committee reports its findings to the CEO and CFO, providing an
effective process to evaluate our external disclosure obligations.

Encouraging strong and effective corporate governance from our Board of
Directors. We have an active, capable and diligent Board that meets the required
standards for independence, and we welcome the Board's oversight as a
representative of the shareholders. Our Audit Committee comprises independent
directors with the financial knowledge and experience to provide appropriate
oversight. We review significant accounting policies, financial reporting and
internal control matters with them and encourage their independent discussions
with our external auditors. Our corporate governance guidelines, as well as the
charter of the Audit Committee and certain other committees of our Board, are
available on our website at www.pg.com.

P&G has a strong history of doing what's right. We know great companies are
built on strong ethical standards and principles. Our financial results are
delivered from that culture of accountability, and we take responsibility for
the quality and accuracy of our financial reporting. We present this information
proudly, with the expectation that those who use it will understand our Company,
recognize our commitment to performance with integrity and share our confidence
in P&G's future.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Management's Discussion and Analysis The purpose of this discussion is to
provide an understanding of our financial results and condition by focusing on
changes in certain key items from year to year. Management's Discussion and
Analysis (MD&A) starts with an overview of the Company, followed by a review of
results of operations and financial condition. Lastly, we provide insight to our
significant accounting policies and estimates, and some other information you
may find useful.

Throughout MD&A, we refer to several measures used by management to evaluate
performance including unit volume growth, net outside sales and after-tax
profit. We also refer to organic sales growth (net sales growth excluding the
impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange), free cash flow
and free cash flow productivity, which are not defined under accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The
explanation of these non-GAAP measures on page 43 provides more details.
Management also uses certain market share estimates to evaluate our performance
relative to competition - although there are limitations on the availability and
comparability of this information. References to market share in MD&A are based
on a combination of vendor-reported consumption and market size data, as well as
internal estimates.

OVERVIEW

Our business is focused on providing branded products of superior quality and
value to improve the lives of the world's consumers. We believe this will lead
to leadership sales, profits and value creation, allowing employees,
shareholders and the communities in which we operate to prosper.

Procter & Gamble markets over 300 branded products in more than 160 countries.
Our products are sold primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores,
membership club stores and drug stores. We compete in five distinct business
segments: Fabric and Home Care, Beauty Care, Baby and Family Care, Health Care
and Snacks and Beverages - and we manage the business and report our results on
this basis. We have operations in over 80 countries through our Market
Development Organization, which leads country business teams to build our brands
in local markets and is organized along seven geographic areas: North America,
Western Europe, Northeast Asia, Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe/Middle
East/Africa, Greater China and ASEAN/Australasia/India.

The following charts provide the percentage of net sales and net earnings by
business segment for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004. These exclude
information for Corporate, since it is not meaningful. For more information,

In May 2004, we announced a realignment of some of our business units and
associated management responsibilities. These changes are designed to streamline
business operations and support further growth of the Company. Beginning with
fiscal year 2004/2005, we will realign to three global business units: Beauty
Care; Health, Baby and Family Care; and Household Care, which will include the
current Fabric and Home Care business and the Snacks and Beverages business. Our
financial reporting will continue to include supplemental information on the
results of the current five business units. Each of the new Global Business
Units and our Market Development Organization will be headed by a vice-chairman
reporting to the chief executive officer. There will be no special charges
associated with the organization realignment. We completed the divestiture of
the Juice business in August 2004. For the fiscal year 2004/2005, results of the
Juice business will be included in Corporate. All historical information will
also be reflected in Corporate to provide segment results on a comparable basis.

Strategic Focus

We are focused on strategies that we believe are right for the long-term health
of the Company and that will increase returns for our shareholders.

Our long-term financial targets include:

- -     Sales growth of 4% to 6% excluding the impact of changes in foreign
      exchange rates from year-over-year comparisons. On average, we expect
      approximately 2% of our growth to come from market growth; 1% to 3% of our
      growth to come from the combination of market share growth, expansion to
      new geographies and new business creation; and the remaining 1% to come
      from smaller, tactical acquisitions to access markets or round out our
      current business portfolios.

- -     Earnings-per-share growth of 10% or better.

- -     Free cash flow productivity greater than 90% (defined as the ratio of
      operating cash flow less capital expenditures divided by net earnings).

In order to achieve these targets, we have focused Procter & Gamble's core
strengths of branding, innovation, go-to-market capability and scale against the
following growth areas:

- -     Drive our core businesses of Baby Care, Fabric Care, Feminine Care and
      Hair Care into stronger global leadership positions.

- -     Grow our leading brands in our biggest markets and with our largest
      customers.

- -     Invest in faster-growing businesses with higher gross margins that are
      less asset-intensive, primarily in the Health Care and Beauty Care
      segments.

- -     Build on opportunities in select developing markets and with lower-income
      consumers.

Sustainability

To sustain consistent and reliable sales and earnings growth in line with
long-term financial targets, we have identified four key enablers:

- -     Building a diversified portfolio consisting of foundation businesses and
      higher growth businesses. Foundation businesses include many of our core
      product categories - those in our Fabric and Home Care, Baby and Family
      Care and Snacks and Beverages segments. These businesses provide a base
      for steady growth, strong operating cash flows and an excellent training
      ground for our future leaders. We are focused on expanding these
      categories through innovative products, offering our brands in more parts
      of the world and tailoring our products to meet the needs of more
      consumers (including lower-income consumers). To complement the steady
      growth of our foundation businesses, we are also focused on expanding our
      portfolio of brands and products to businesses with higher expected growth
      rates, particularly in the Health Care and Beauty Care segments. These
      segments generally have higher gross margins and lower capital
      requirements than the balance of the Company's portfolio. Over the past
      several years, we have increased the size of our Health Care and Beauty
      Care businesses and expect them to continue to provide a disproportionate
      percentage of growth for the Company.

- -     Investing in innovation and capability to reach more of the world's
      consumers with quality, affordable products. This not only includes a
      strong pipeline of initiatives on the base businesses, but also expansion
      of our brands to more geographies where we currently

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

      do not have a major market presence. In addition, we are investing in
      innovation and capability to meet the needs of lower-income consumers, who
      may find our products unaffordable for daily use.

- -     Leveraging the Company's organizational structure to drive clear focus,
      accountability and improved go-to-market capability. We have an
      organizational structure that works together to leverage our knowledge and
      scale at the global level with a deep understanding of the consumer and
      customer at the local level. The Global Business Units (GBUs) leverage
      their deep consumer understanding to develop the overall strategy for our
      brands and are focused on delivering superior products, packaging and
      marketing. Working closely with the GBUs, the Market Development
      Organization (MDO) develops go-to-market plans at the local level,
      leveraging their understanding of the local consumer and customer. The MDO
      is focused on winning the "first moment of truth" - when a consumer stands
      in front of the shelf and chooses a product from among many competitive
      offerings. The GBU is focused on winning the "second moment of truth" -
      when the consumer uses the product and evaluates how well the product
      meets their expectations. Global Business Services (GBS) operates as the
      "back office" for the GBU and MDO organizations, providing world-class
      technology, processes and standard data tools to better understand the
      business and better serve consumers and customers. Services are provided
      by either GBS personnel or by partnering with highly efficient and
      effective providers.

- -     Focusing relentlessly to improve costs and generate cash. Each business
      unit is evaluated on their ability to improve profit margins and generate
      cash, for example, by increasing capacity utilization and meeting capital
      spending targets.

Summary of 2004 Results

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004, our sales, earnings and free cash flow
grew above our long-term targets.

- -     Every business segment and, within the MDO, every geographic region posted
      volume growth.

- -     We increased our overall market share, with share growth in categories
      representing approximately 70% of the Company's net sales. We increased
      market share in each of our core businesses of Baby Care, Fabric Care,
      Feminine Care and Hair Care.

- -     Net sales increased 19%, including the impact of the Wella acquisition
      that was completed in September 2003. Organic sales increased 8%.

- -     Net earnings increased 25% behind higher volume and the completion of the
      Company's restructuring program, which reduced earnings by $538 million in
      2003.

- -     Operating cash flows were $9.36 billion. Free cash flow productivity was
      113%.

Market Overview and Challenges

Our market environment is highly competitive, with both global and local
competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our
products, we compete against branded products, as well as retailer and
private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we
compete are differentiated by price (referred to as premium, mid-tier and
value-tier products). Generally speaking, we compete with premium and mid-tier
products and are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which
we operate - often holding a leadership or significant share position.

- -     Our Fabric and Home Care business operates in a global market containing
      numerous brands in each geography. We generally have the number one or
      number two share position in the markets in which we compete, with
      particular strength in North America and Western Europe. Fabric Care is
      one of our core businesses and we are the global market leader with
      approximately a 31% share. Three of our billion-dollar brands are part of
      the Fabric and Home Care business: Tide, Ariel and Downy.

- -     We compete in several categories of the Beauty Care market including
      Retail and Professional Hair Care, Skin Care, Feminine Care, Cosmetics,
      Fine Fragrances and Personal Cleansing. The Beauty Care markets in which
      we compete comprise approximately $170 billion in global sales, resulting
      in our having an overall share position of about 10%. Hair Care, one of
      our core businesses, is the market leader with approximately a 20% share
      of the global market. We are also the global share leader in the Feminine
      Care category, another core business, with approximately a 35% share of
      the market. Billion-dollar brands in Beauty Care include Pantene, Wella,
      Olay, Always and Head & Shoulders.

- -     In Baby and Family Care, we compete primarily in the Diapers, Baby Wipes,
      Bath Tissue and Kitchen Towel categories. Baby Care is one of our core
      businesses with a global share of approximately 36% of the market behind
      the strength of Pampers, a $5 billion-dollar brand. The markets in which
      we compete generally include two to three global companies, as well as
      local competitors and retailer brands. Family Care is predominantly a
      North American business with the Bounty and Charmin brands, each with
      annual sales over one billion dollars.

- -     Our Health Care business competes in several distinct product categories
      including Oral Care, Pharmaceuticals, Over-the-counter (OTC)
      Gastrointestinal and Respiratory Medications and Pet Health and Nutrition.
      In Oral Care, there are four global competitors in the market, of which we
      have the number two share position. Our Pharmaceuticals business has
      almost 30% of the global bisphosphonates market for the treatment of
      osteoporosis under the Actonel brand. Actonel, along with Crest and Iams,
      each have annual sales over one billion dollars.

                                            MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

- -     In Snacks and Beverages, we compete primarily in two industry categories:
      Salted Snacks and Coffee. In Salted Snacks, we compete against both global
      and local companies. One global company dominates the category. In Coffee,
      we hold a leadership position of the brands sold predominantly through
      grocery, mass merchandise and club membership stores in the United States
      (U.S.). We recently completed the divestiture of our Juice business. Two
      of our billion-dollar brands are in Snacks and Beverages - Pringles and
      Folgers.

Forward-Looking Statements

We discuss expectations regarding our future performance and future events and
outcomes, such as our business outlook and long-term objectives, in our annual
and quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications.
All statements, except for historical and present factual information, are
"forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the "safe harbor" provisions
of the Private Security Litigation Reform Act, and are based on currently
available competitive, financial and economic data and our business plans.
Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must
recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations.

Ability to Achieve Business Plans. We are a consumer products company and rely
on continued demand for our products. To achieve our business plans, we must
develop and sell products that appeal to our consumers and customers. Our
continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation (with respect to both
products and operations) and effective sales, advertising and marketing programs
in an increasingly fragmented media environment. Our ability to innovate and
execute in these areas will determine the extent to which we are able to grow
existing sales and volume profitably despite high levels of competitive
activity, especially with respect to the product categories and geographic
markets (including developing markets) in which we have chosen to focus. There
continues to be competitive product and pricing pressures in the environments in
which we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. We must
manage each of these, as well as maintain mutually beneficial relationships with
our key customers, in order to effectively compete and achieve our business
plans. Since our long-term goals include a growth component tied to
acquisitions, we must manage and integrate key acquisitions, including the Wella
acquisition.

Cost Pressures. Our costs are not fixed but fluctuate, particularly due to
currency and interest rate fluctuations and the cost of labor and raw materials.
Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage
these fluctuations through pricing actions, sourcing decisions and certain
hedging transactions. In the manufacturing and general overhead areas, we need
to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including sole supplier
and sole plant arrangements, and successfully implement, achieve and sustain
cost improvement plans, including our outsourcing projects.

Global Economic Conditions. Economic changes, terrorist activity and political
unrest may result in business interruption, inflation, deflation or decreased
demand for our products. Our success will depend in part on our ability to
manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our
significant geographical markets, as well as any political or economic
disruption due to terrorist activities.

Regulatory Environment. Changes in laws, regulations and the related
interpretations, including changes in laws that affect our products, as well as
changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, competition laws and
environmental laws, may alter the environment in which we do business.
Accordingly, our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters and to
resolve pending matters within current estimates may impact our results.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Volume and Net Sales

Unit volume for the 2004 fiscal year increased 17%, with all business segments
and geographic regions achieving unit volume growth. Unit volume growth was led
by Beauty Care, up 37%, and Health Care, up 18%. Excluding the impact of
acquisitions and divestitures, primarily Wella, unit volume for the Company
increased 10%. This exceeded prior year results due to the volume growth on our
largest brands, double-digit gains from developing markets, incremental volume
from product initiatives and an overall increase in our market share position.

- -     Unit volume in developing markets increased 19%, led by strong gains in
      Greater China.

- -     Each of our top 16 brands increased volume versus the prior year
      (representing approximately 55% of total Company volume).

- -     All 16 of our top countries increased volume (representing approximately
      85% of total unit volume).

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Sales reached a record level of $51.41 billion in 2004, an increase of 19%.
Organic sales increased 8%, well above our long-term target. Net sales increased
behind volume growth, including the addition of Wella, and a positive foreign
exchange impact of 4% due primarily to the strengthening of the Euro, British
pound and Canadian dollar. Product mix reduced sales growth by 1%, reflecting
higher growth in developing markets, including Greater China and Latin America,
which generally have an average unit sales price lower than the Company average.
Pricing adjustments reduced sales growth by 1% as we sharpened Family Care and
Coffee category pricing to remain competitive on shelf. We also took pricing
actions to improve consumer value and stimulate growth in selected product
categories, including Fabric Care and Feminine Care.

</TABLE>

Net sales in 2003 were $43.38 billion, exceeding 2002 sales by $3.14 billion, or
8%. Volume growth of 8% was broad-based, with particular strength in Fabric and
Home Care, Beauty Care and Health Care. Net sales included a favorable foreign
exchange impact of 2%, as the strength of the Euro was partially offset by
weakness in certain Latin American currencies. The foreign exchange impact was
offset by pricing of 2% to deliver consistent consumer value, stimulate growth
and remain competitive in key categories, including Diapers, Tissue, Hair Care,
Feminine Care, Teeth Whitening and Coffee.

Operating Costs

Gross margin in 2004 was 51.2%, an increase of 220 basis points versus the
previous year. Charges for the restructuring program that was substantially
completed in 2003 accounted for 80 basis points of the improvement. Of the
remaining gross margin expansion, approximately 90 basis points was driven by
the scale benefit of increased volume and 40 basis points was due to the
addition of Wella, which has a higher gross margin than the balance of the
Company. Supply chain savings and favorable product mix benefits were offset by
the impact of higher commodity costs and pricing actions. In 2003, gross margin
was 49.0% which was an improvement of 120 basis points versus 2002. Lower
restructuring program charges accounted for 40 basis points of the improvement,
with the remainder due to lower material costs and the benefits of our supply
chain savings programs. Before-tax restructuring program charges included in
cost of products sold were $381 million in 2003 and $508 million in 2002.

                                            MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Selling, General and Administrative expense (SG&A) in 2004 was 32.1% of net
sales, an increase of 120 basis points compared to the previous year. The
majority of the basis point increase is due to Wella, reflecting a higher ratio
of SG&A expense to net sales than the base business. Restructuring program
charges in the base period, that accounted for an improvement of 90 basis
points, were more than offset by increases in marketing spending. Marketing
investments were made behind product launches including Prilosec OTC, Crest
Whitestrips Premium and the expansion of Olay Regenerist, as well as continued
support for the base business. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales
in 2003 versus 2002 was driven by lower restructuring program charges which more
than offset additional marketing investments behind new product launches and
expansions of existing brands, including Tide with Bleach, Swiffer Duster, Crest
Whitestrips and Olay Regenerist. SG&A included before-tax restructuring program
charges of $374 million in 2003 and $519 million in 2002.

</TABLE>

Non-Operating Items

Non-operating items include interest expense, divestiture gains and losses, as
well as interest and investment income.

Interest expense increased $68 million to $629 million in 2004, primarily due to
additional debt to support the acquisition of Wella. Interest expense was $561
million in 2003 and $603 million in 2002. The decline in interest expense in
2003 versus 2002 was driven by lower debt balances and interest rates. Going
forward, we expect interest expense to increase, reflecting both debt levels and
rates, as well as the interest associated with the guaranteed dividend payment
to Wella minority shareholders.

Other non-operating income was $152 million in 2004 compared to $238 million in
2003 and $308 million in 2002. Over the three year period, non-operating income
declined primarily due to lower gains from divestitures. During the
restructuring program, we divested non-strategic brands. As this activity has
declined, other non-operating income has trended lower. Next fiscal year,
non-operating income may increase, reflecting the divestiture of the Juice
business in August 2004.

The effective tax rate for 2004 declined 40 basis points driven primarily by the
country mix impact of foreign operations, as earnings increased
disproportionately in countries with lower overall tax rates. The country mix
impacts of foreign operations reduced the Company's effective tax rate to a
larger degree in 2004 and 2003 than in 2002. The tax rate is expected to decline
again in 2005, absent any legislative changes that affect current plans.

Net Earnings

Net earnings in 2004 increased 25% over the prior year. Earnings growth was
primarily driven by increased volume and the completion of the Company's
restructuring program. Improvements to earnings from gross margin expansion were
partially offset by increased marketing spending to support product initiatives
and base business growth. The acquisition of Wella had no material impact on
earnings.

Prior year results include $538 million of after-tax charges related to our
restructuring program, which represents approximately 10 percentage points of
the earnings growth. These charges covered enrollment reductions, manufacturing
consolidations and portfolio choices to scale back or discontinue
under-performing businesses and initiatives. The restructuring program was
substantially completed in 2003. Beginning this year, we are continuing to take
the necessary, on-going actions to maintain a competitive cost structure, but
such activities are part of normal operations.

In 2003, net earnings increased 19% compared to 2002, representing a 120 basis
point increase in earnings margin. Increased earnings were driven by volume
growth, the shift in mix to higher profit products in the Health Care and Beauty
Care segments, lower restructuring program costs and improved gross margin.
After-tax restructuring program charges were down $168 million compared to total
charges of $706 million in 2002.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Diluted net earnings per share were $2.32, an increase of 25%, and above our
long-term target. Diluted net earnings per share were $1.85 in 2003 and $1.54 in
2002, including restructuring program impacts of $0.19 and $0.26 per share,
respectively.

2004            2.32
</TABLE>

Net Earnings Margins

The progressive increase in net earnings margin to 12.6% reflects the scale
benefits from higher volume and the completion of our restructuring program, as
well as improvements due to cost savings and the shift to businesses with a
higher margin than the Company average.

SEGMENT RESULTS

Product-based segment results reflect information on the same basis we use for
internal management reporting and performance evaluation. These segment results
exclude certain costs included in the Consolidated Financial Statements (e.g.,
interest expense, other financing costs, investing activities and certain
restructuring costs), which are reported in Corporate.

As described in Note 12 of the financial statements, we have investments in
certain companies where we do not control the financial and operating decisions
and, therefore, do not consolidate them ("unconsolidated entities"). Because
these investments are managed as integral parts of the Company's business units,
they are accounted for as if they were consolidated subsidiaries for management
and segment purposes.

This means we recognize 100% of each income statement component to before-tax
earnings and eliminate the minority interest to determine segment after-tax
earnings. Included in Corporate are entries to eliminate the individual revenue
and expense line items, adjusting the method of accounting to the equity method
as required by U.S. GAAP.

Fabric and Home Care

Fabric and Home Care unit volume was up 9% behind growth on established brands
such as Tide, Ariel, Gain and Ace and the success of initiatives including Mr.
Clean Magic Eraser, Mr. Clean AutoDry, Swiffer Duster, Gain Fabric Enhancer and
the expansion of Febreze. Both the Fabric Care and Home Care businesses continue
to grow or maintain market share on most key brands. Net sales increased 10%, to
$13.87 billion. Sales growth includes a positive 3% foreign exchange impact.
Pricing of negative 1% was primarily driven by actions to maintain competitive
shelf pricing in key geographies, including North America and Western Europe.
Mix reduced sales by 1% driven primarily by double-digit growth in developing
markets, including the continued success of initiatives such as Tide Clean White
in China and Downy One Rinse in Latin America. Products in developing markets
generally have a lower average sales rate per unit than the segment average.

Net earnings increased 7% to $2.20 billion. Net earnings margin was down
slightly compared to 2003 due to the mix effect of disproportionate growth
outside of the U.S. (as we expanded our business in certain geographies
including China, India and Eastern Europe) and marketing investments behind new
product initiatives. Startup costs for increased liquid detergent capacity in
North America to support new product initiative activity and investments in
supply chain optimization also contributed to the lower net earnings margin.

26 The Procter & Gamble Company and Subsidiaries

                                            MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

In 2003, volume grew 9%. Net sales increased 8% to $12.56 billion compared to
$11.62 billion in 2002. Foreign exchange contributed a positive impact of 1% to
overall sales, driven primarily by the strength of the Euro. Sales were
negatively impacted by 1% due to pricing, primarily in North America and Western
Europe. Sales were also reduced by 1% from mix due to growth of lower-priced
products, including rapid growth in developing markets and broadening of the
mid-tier portfolio of brands in major geographies. Net earnings were $2.06
billion, a 12% increase from $1.83 billion in 2002, driven primarily by volume
growth and lower manufacturing costs. The impact of volume growth and lower
manufacturing costs on earnings was partially offset by increased marketing
spending in support of new product launches and expansion of existing brands.

Beauty Care

Beauty Care unit volume increased 37%. Excluding the impact of the Wella
acquisition, unit volume increased 10% behind broad-based growth in the Hair
Care, Personal Beauty Care and Feminine Care businesses. Global Hair Care volume
increased double-digits, despite low single-digit growth in North America, with
particular progress on the Head & Shoulders, Pantene, Herbal Essences and
Rejoice brands. In Feminine Care, double-digit volume growth was driven by
Always/Alldays, Tampax Pearl in the U.S. and Naturella in Latin America. In
Personal Beauty Care, Olay and SK-II delivered double-digit volume growth, as
did the Fine Fragrances business. Net sales increased 40% to $17.12 billion.
Sales growth includes a positive foreign exchange impact of 4%, partially offset
by negative pricing of 1%. Pricing includes actions to support the Hair Care,
Colorants and Cosmetics businesses in North America and the Feminine Care
business in Western Europe. Overall Beauty Care market share increased, as sales
growth out-paced market growth in key categories including Skin Care, Feminine
Care and Hair Care products.

Net earnings increased 22% to $2.42 billion. Volume benefits, including the
addition of Wella, and lower material costs were partially offset by marketing
investments to support product initiatives and the base business. Earnings
margin decreased due to the impact of the higher SG&A expense ratio for Wella.
The Wella acquisition was accretive to Beauty Care earnings and had no material
impact on Company earnings after including the impacts of interest and
amortization expense, which are included in Corporate. Going forward, we will
continue to make progress on collaboration plans designed to deliver synergies
and margin progress. Some of these actions will result in additional one-time
charges next year largely to be reflected in Corporate as part of the Company's
ongoing effort to maintain a competitive cost structure. Excluding these
impacts, Wella is expected to be accretive to the Beauty Care segment and about
neutral to the Company in 2005.

In 2003, unit volume grew 15%. Excluding the impacts of the Clairol acquisition,
unit volume increased 8% led by growth in Hair Care. Net sales grew 14% to
$12.22 billion, as volume increases and a positive 3% impact from foreign
exchange were partially offset by a negative 2% impact from pricing and 2% from
mix. Pricing was driven by price reductions taken to expand our portfolio of
Hair Care brands to consumers that shop within the category's lower-priced,
mid-tier brands. The mix impact was driven by the increased sales of Clairol
brands, which carry lower revenue per unit than the Company's base Hair Care
brands. Net earnings grew 23% to $1.98 billion. Approximately half of this
increase was driven by volume, with the remainder driven by reductions in
manufacturing costs through restructuring, base savings programs and lower
material costs. Lower overhead spending due, in part, to the Clairol
integration, was offset by investments in marketing. In 2002, Beauty Care net
sales were $10.72 billion and net earnings were $1.61 billion.

Baby and Family Care

Baby and Family Care unit volume increased 6% driven primarily by double-digit
growth in Baby Care, including gains in Western Europe and developing markets,
and low single-digit growth in Family Care. Family Care volume growth reflects a
difficult competitive environment marked by increased promotional spending,
particularly in North America. Net sales for the segment grew 8% to $10.72
billion including a positive foreign exchange impact of 4%. Sales were
negatively impacted by pricing of 1%, primarily due to increased competitive
promotional activity in North America Family Care. Mix reduced sales by 1% due
primarily to strong Baby Care growth in developing markets, where unit sales
prices are generally lower than the segment average.

Net earnings were $996 million, an increase of 13% compared to 2003. Baby Care
delivered profit growth from higher volume and product cost savings. Family Care
earnings declined slightly due to increases in commodity costs (both pulp and
natural gas) and increased spending for pricing. We announced North America
Family Care increased prices effective in July to partially recover increases in
commodity costs.

In 2003, Baby and Family Care delivered unit volume growth of 7%. Net sales grew
8% to $9.93 billion compared to $9.23 billion in 2002. Sales growth included a
3% positive foreign exchange impact and 1% positive mix impact, partially offset
by a 3% negative impact from pricing. Positive mix was driven by increased sales
of higher-priced, premium-tier diapers. The pricing impact was driven by
targeted investments to match competitive pricing and merchandising across the
segment, primarily in North America and Western Europe. Net earnings were $882
million, an increase of 20% compared to $738 million in 2002.

                                The Procter & Gamble Company and Subsidiaries 27

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Earnings growth was primarily achieved through increased scale from volume
growth and lower product cost behind base business and restructuring savings.

Health Care

Health Care unit volume increased 18%. All categories grew volume, with
double-digit gains in the Pharmaceutical, Personal Health Care and Oral Care
businesses, as well as solid growth in Pet Health and Nutrition. Volume was
driven by initiatives, including the successful launch of Prilosec OTC and the
continued expansion of Actonel. Developing markets also delivered double-digit
volume gains, particularly in China behind Crest. Net sales increased 21% to
$6.99 billion. Foreign exchange increased sales 3%.

Net earnings increased 36% to $962 million. Earnings growth was primarily driven
by sales growth behind initiatives and margin expansion due to product mix,
manufacturing cost savings and lower overhead spending as a percentage of sales.
Product mix expanded margin as Pharmaceuticals, which has a higher margin than
the balance of the business, made up a larger percentage of segment sales.
Mix-driven margin expansion was negatively impacted by increased marketing
spending behind the strong initiative program and a growing base business. Each
category delivered double-digit earnings growth.

In 2003, unit volume increased 18% led by Oral Care and Pharmaceuticals. Net
sales for the year were $5.80 billion, an increase of 16% as compared to $4.98
billion in 2002. A favorable foreign exchange impact of 2% was more than offset
by a negative pricing impact of 2%, primarily driven by lower pricing on Crest
Whitestrips in response to a competitive entry, and a negative mix impact of 2%.
The negative product mix impact was primarily driven by growth in developing
markets and a shift in Actonel volume mix, which is sold under an alliance
agreement, to support the global Once-a-week dosage launch. Net earnings for
Health Care were $706 million, an increase of 35% compared to $521 million in
2002. The majority of the increase was driven by volume growth and the shift to
higher-margin Oral Care and Pharmaceuticals products, partially offset by
additional marketing investments to support product initiatives.

Snacks and Beverages

Snacks and Beverages unit volume increased 4%. Folgers and Pringles, each with
sales in excess of one billion dollars, grew volume by mid-single digits. Net
sales were $3.48 billion, an increase of 8%. Foreign exchange positively
impacted sales by 4%. Product mix increased sales by 1%, primarily driven by
faster growth of Folgers, which has a higher unit sales rate than the segment
average. Pricing reduced sales by 1% reflecting high promotional spending in the
Coffee category.

Net earnings were $363 million, an increase of 19%, as volume and base business
savings more than offset higher commodity costs.

In 2003, unit volume declined 2% reflecting the impact of the business
interruption on Snacks shipments caused by tornado damage to the Jackson,
Tennessee manufacturing facility, as well as softness in the Juice category. Net
sales were $3.24 billion, or essentially flat versus the previous year. Sales
growth included a positive 3% impact from foreign exchange and 1% impact from
mix, which were partially offset by a negative 2% impact from pricing. Net
earnings were $306 million compared to $303 million in 2002. Despite the impact
of the tornado and lower volume, net earnings increased due to reductions in
cost of products sold, reflecting the impact of both base business and
restructuring savings.

In August 2004, the Company divested the Juice business. The gain associated
with the divestiture will likely be offset by lost contribution within the
fiscal year. Effective July 1, 2004, the current and historical results of Juice
will be reflected in Corporate.

Corporate

Corporate includes amounts and activities not allocated to specific business
units. These include: the results of incidental businesses managed at the
corporate level, financing and investing activities, intangible asset
amortization, certain restructuring charges and other general corporate items.
In addition, Corporate generally includes the historical results of divested
businesses, including the Jif and Crisco businesses, which were spun off from
the former Food and Beverage segment.

Corporate net sales primarily reflect the adjustment to eliminate the sales of
unconsolidated entities included in business segment results. In 2002, Corporate
also includes the net sales of Jif and Crisco, which were spun off. Corporate
earnings improved in 2004, as the prior year included restructuring program
charges. This improvement was partially offset by higher interest and intangible
asset amortization charges associated with Wella, hedging impacts and current
year charges for projects to maintain a competitive cost structure. Lower
Corporate earnings in 2003 primarily reflected the impact of the Jif and Crisco
operations in the base period. Corporate earnings were also lower due to
increased financing of employee benefit plans and hedging impacts from a
stronger Euro, partially offset by decreased restructuring program costs.

                                            MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

FINANCIAL CONDITION

We believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced
by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and ready access to
capital markets at competitive rates. We do not anticipate material changes to
cash flow trends, although actual cash and debt balances will be influenced by a
variety of factors, including acquisitions and other investment opportunities.
For example, there is currently proposed legislation in the U.S. that could
precipitate a substantial short-term change in our cash repatriation patterns
under favorable conditions. Such an opportunity, and its implications, would
need to be addressed once the provisions of the law are finalized and enacted.

Operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds to finance operating
needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund
shareholder dividends. Other discretionary uses include share repurchase
activities and acquisitions. As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow
with debt to fund these activities. The overall cash position of the Company
reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that
takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax
considerations. This includes the potential tax on repatriating cash balances to
the U.S. versus other long-term offshore funding opportunities.

Operating Activities

In 2004, operating cash flow was $9.36 billion compared to $8.70 billion in
2003, representing an increase of 8%. Higher net earnings were the primary
driver of the increase in operating cash flow. Operating cash flow growth
trailed earnings growth due to an increase in accounts receivable, cash payments
for restructuring program charges accrued last fiscal year and a dividend
received from a joint venture in the base period.

The impacts of business growth on cash flow have been kept to a minimum as a
result of the Company's focus on cash management. Accounts receivable days sales
outstanding and inventory days on hand improved from June 30, 2003, excluding
the impact of Wella.

We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor
impacting the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary
investment. It is defined as cash from operating activities less capital
expenditures and is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and
determine their at-risk compensation. In 2004, free cash flow was $7.34 billion
compared to $7.22 billion in 2003 and $6.06 billion in 2002. Free cash flow in
2004 reflects increased operating cash flow, partially offset by increased
capital expenditures, although spending was in line with our target of capital
spending at or below 4% of sales. Capital spending in 2003 was well below
historical levels and the long-term target.

Free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net
earnings, was 113%, above the Company's long-term target of 90%. Free cash flow
productivity was 139% in 2003.

Investing Activities

Acquisitions. Net cash used for acquisitions in 2004 was $7.48 billion. The
primary drivers were the acquisition of Wella and the purchase of the remaining
stake in our China venture with Hutchison Whampoa China Ltd. (Hutchison). The
initial Wella acquisition in September 2003 was approximately $5.10 billion for
an 81% interest, funded by a combination of debt and cash. In June 2004, the
Company and Wella completed a domination and profit transfer agreement, which
provided us full operating control and rights to 100% of future operating
results. In exchange, we must pay the remaining Wella shareholders a guaranteed
annual dividend payment. Alternatively, the Wella shareholders may elect to
tender the shares for a fixed price. The obligation associated with the
domination agreement is $1.11 billion and has been recognized as a current
liability. The portion of the acquisition related to the domination agreement
represents a non-cash transaction. Future payments related to the principal
portion of the annual dividend arrangement or acquisition of shares tendered
will be reflected as investing activities, consistent with the underlying
transaction.

The gross cash outlay for Hutchison was $2.00 billion, which also includes the
settlement of minority interest and certain other liabilities, for a net cost of
$1.85 billion. The acquisition was funded by debt. We also completed certain
smaller acquisitions with an aggregate cost of $384 million, including Glide
dental floss and Fabric Care brands in Western Europe, Latin America and the
Middle East. Net cash for acquisitions was $61 million in 2003 and $5.47 billion
in 2002, primarily for the Clairol acquisition.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Capital Spending. Capital spending efficiency continues to be a critical
component of the Company's overall cash management strategy. Our goal is to
maintain capital spending at or below 4% of net sales. Total capital spending
was $2.02 billion in 2004 versus $1.48 billion in 2003 and $1.68 billion in
2002. Capital spending as a percentage of net sales was 3.9% in 2004, in line
with the Company's long-term target. Capital spending increased as a percent of
net sales in 2004 primarily in support of capacity expansion projects in the
Fabric and Home Care and the Baby and Family Care businesses. In 2003, capital
spending as a percent of net sales was 3.4%, a significant decline versus 2002,
which included considerable spending behind capacity additions. Over the past
several years, we have made systemic interventions to improve capital spending
efficiencies and asset utilization. While the Company's goal is to maintain
capital expenditures at or below 4% of sales on an ongoing basis, there may be
exceptional years when specific business circumstances, such as capacity
additions, may lead to higher spending.

Financing Activities

Dividend Payments. One of our first discretionary uses of cash is dividend
payments. Common share dividends grew 13% to $0.93 per share in 2004,
representing the 48th consecutive fiscal year of increased common share
dividends. Total dividend payments, to both common and preferred shareholders,
were $2.54 billion, $2.25 billion and $2.10 billion in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

[BAR CHART]

Dividends
(per share)

Long-Term and Short-Term Debt. The Company maintains debt levels it considers
appropriate considering a number of factors, including cash flow expectations,
cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment plans (including
acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and the overall cost of capital.
Total debt increased in 2004 by $7.19 billion to $20.84 billion. The increase
was primarily due to the acquisitions of Wella and the Hutchison minority
interest, along with discretionary treasury share purchases. Debt due within one
year increased to $8.29 billion in 2004, reflecting the decision to finance
acquisition and share repurchase activity with commercial paper, given favorable
rates. Total debt in 2003 was $13.65 billion compared to $14.93 billion in 2002.
The decrease in 2003 was primarily due to the utilization of cash flow from
operations to pay down existing balances.

Long-term borrowing available under our current shelf registration statement was
$8.56 billion at June 30, 2004. The Company's Standard & Poor's (S&P) and
Moody's short-term credit ratings are A-1+ and P-1, respectively. Our S&P and
Moody's long-term credit ratings are AA- and Aa3, respectively.

Liquidity. As discussed previously, our primary source of liquidity is cash
generated from operations. We believe internally-generated cash flows adequately
support business operations, capital expenditures and shareholder dividends, as
well as a level of discretionary investments (e.g., acquisitions and share
repurchases). The Company is able to supplement its short-term liquidity, if
necessary, with broad access to capital markets and $2.00 billion in bank credit
facilities. Broad access to financing includes commercial paper programs in
multiple markets at favorable rates given our strong credit ratings (including
separate U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar and Euro multi-currency programs). We
maintain two bank credit facilities: a $1.00 billion, five-year facility which
matures in July 2007 and a $1.00 billion, five-year facility which matures in
July 2009. The Company has never drawn against either facility and has no plans
to do so in the foreseeable future.

The credit facilities available to us do not have cross-default or ratings
triggers, nor do they have material adverse events clauses, except at the time
of signing. While not considered material to the overall financial condition of
the Company, there is a covenant in the credit facilities stating the ratio of
net debt to earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization cannot exceed four at the time of a draw on the facility. As of
June 30, we are comfortably below this level, with a ratio of approximately 1.3.

                                            MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Treasury Purchases. During the past year, we substantially increased our level
of share repurchases. In 2004, treasury share purchases used $4.07 billion
compared to $1.24 billion in 2003 and $568 million in 2002. We purchase the
Company's common stock on the open market.While the actual level of annual
activity can vary, our intent generally is to purchase at least a sufficient
number of shares to mitigate the dilutive impact of options. Beyond that, we may
make additional discretionary purchases based on cash availability, market
trends and other factors. We believe this share repurchase activity represents
an alternative vehicle to provide value to shareholders. Lower share purchases
in 2003 and 2002 reflect the need to preserve capital ahead of the Wella and
Clairol acquisitions, respectively. Although no formal plan exists, we expect to
continue to repurchase shares, with the ultimate amount depending on cash flow
and alternate investment options.

Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We do not have guarantees
or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest
entities, that we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or
liquidity.

Contractual Commitments. The table below provides information on our contractual
commitments as of June 30, 2004.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

In preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are
certain accounting policies that are particularly important. These include
revenue recognition, income taxes, certain employee benefits and goodwill and
intangible assets. We believe these accounting policies, and others set forth in
Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are
integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of
the Company. In some cases, these policies simply represent required accounting.
In others, they may represent a choice between acceptable accounting methods or
may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application.

Due to the nature of our business, these estimates generally are not considered
highly uncertain at the time of estimation, meaning they are not expected to
result in a change that would materially affect our results of operations or
financial condition in any given year.

The Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and
the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of
Directors.

    represent future purchases in line with expected usage to obtain favorable
    pricing. Approximately 60% relates to service contracts for information
    technology, human resources management and facilities management activities
    that were outsourced in recent years. While the amounts listed represent
    contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that the full
    contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled
    prior to maturity. In such cases, we generally are able to negotiate new
    contracts or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment. The
    amounts do not include obligations related to other contractual purchase
    obligations that are not take-or-pay arrangements. Such contractual purchase
    obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of
    normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow
    trends. We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect
    our liquidity position.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Revenue Recognition

Most of our revenue transactions represent sales of inventory, and we recognize
revenue when title, ownership and risk of loss transfers to the customer. A
provision for payment discounts and product return allowances is recorded as a
reduction of sales within the same period that the revenue is recognized. We
offer sales incentives through various programs, consisting primarily of
customer pricing allowances, merchandising funds and consumer coupons. The cost
of these programs is recorded as a reduction of sales. Given the nature of our
business, revenue recognition practices do not contain estimates that materially
affect results of operations.

Income Taxes

Our annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and
the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial
reporting purposes. Tax law requires items to be included in the tax return at
different times than the items reflected in the financial statements. As a
result, our annual tax rate reflected in our financial statements is different
than reported on our tax return (our cash tax rates). Some of these differences
are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return and
some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as depreciation
expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.

Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax
deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax
benefit in our income statement. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent
tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been
deferred, or expenditures for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax
return but have not yet recognized in our financial statements.

Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business
plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes.
Realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating
sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the
expiration of the carry-forward periods. Although realization is not assured,
management believes it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets, net of
valuation allowances, will be realized.

Changes in existing tax laws, tax rates and their related interpretations may
also affect our ability to successfully manage the impacts of regulatory matters
around the world. The Company establishes reserves for tax positions that
management believes are supportable, but are subject to successful challenge by
the applicable taxing authority. The Company reviews these in light of the
changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit, and will
adjust them when significant changes in risk warrant it. The Company has a
number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the results of
these audits are uncertain, based on currently available information, the
Company believes that the ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company's financial position, cash flow or earnings.

Our accounting represents management's best estimate of future events than can
be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates. Certain changes or
future events, such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings,
completion of tax audits or modification of cash repatriation plans could have
an impact on the Company's estimates and effective tax rate.

Employee Benefits

We sponsor various post-employment benefits throughout the world. These include
pension plans, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, and
other post-employment benefit (OPEB) plans, consisting primarily of health care
and life insurance for retirees. For accounting purposes, the defined benefit
and OPEB plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated
benefit obligations, including discount rate, expected salary increases and
health care cost trend rates. These and other assumptions, including the
expected return on plan assets, also affect the annual expense recognized for
these plans. Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's
best judgment regarding future expectations.

The expected return on plan assets assumption is important, since many of our
defined benefit plans and our primary OPEB plan are funded. The process for
setting the expected rates of return is described in Note 9 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. For 2004, the average return on assets assumption for
pension plan assets is 7.4%. A change in the rate of return of 1% would impact
annual benefit expense by approximately $15 million after tax. For 2004, the
return on assets assumption for OPEB assets is 9.5%. A 1% change in the rate of
return would impact annual benefit expense by approximately $20 million after
tax.

Since pension and OPEB liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the
discount rate is a significant assumption. The discount rates used for defined
benefit and OPEB plans are set by benchmarking against investment grade
corporate bonds rated AA or better. The average rate on the defined benefit
plans of 5.2% represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where
such plans exist. A 0.5% reduction in the discount rate would increase annual
benefit expense by approximately $25 million after tax. The rate on the OPEB
plan of 6.1% reflects the higher interest rates generally available in the U.S.,
which is where a majority of the plan participants receive benefits. A 0.5%
reduction in the discount rate would increase annual benefit expense by
approximately $5 million after tax.

32 The Procter & Gamble Company and Subsidiaries

                                            MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Certain defined contribution pension and OPEB benefits in the U.S. are funded by
the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), as discussed in Note 9 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

We also have employee stock option plans which are accounted for under the
intrinsic value recognition and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles
Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and
related interpretations. As stock options have been issued with exercise prices
equal to the market value of the underlying shares on the grant date, no
compensation expense has resulted. Notes 1 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements provide supplemental information, including pro forma earnings and
earnings per share, as if the Company had accounted for options based on the
fair value method prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." The estimate of fair
value requires a number of assumptions, including estimated option life and
future volatility of the underlying stock price. Changes in these assumptions
could significantly impact the estimated fair value of the stock options, as
could a change in valuation methodology (e.g., from Black-Scholes to a different
binomial method).

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The Company seeks to deliver value from innovation by building brands and
businesses. In many cases, brands are created internally, and the costs are
expensed as incurred. In other cases, brands and businesses may be acquired,
which generally results in intangible assets recognized in the financial
statements. These intangibles may represent indefinite-lived assets (e.g.,
certain trademarks or brands), definite-lived intangibles (e.g., patents) or
residual goodwill. Of these, only the costs of definite-lived intangibles are
amortized to expense over their estimated life. The classification of
intangibles and the determination of the appropriate life requires substantial
judgment. Our history demonstrates that many of the Company's brands have very
long lives and our objective is to generally maintain them indefinitely. For
accounting purposes, we evaluate a number of factors to determine whether an
indefinite life is appropriate, including the competitive environment, market
share, brand history, operating plan and the macroeconomic environment of the
country in which the brand is sold. If it is determined that an intangible does
not have an indefinite life, our policy is to amortize the balance over the
expected useful life, which generally ranges from 5 to 20 years.

We test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least
annually, by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the
reporting unit level.

Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of
operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows.
Assumptions used in the Company's impairment evaluations, such as forecasted
growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and
operating plans. For intangible assets subject to amortization, we review the
remaining life of the assets on an annual basis to determine whether events or
circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. The
value of goodwill and intangible assets from recently-acquired businesses are
derived from the current macroeconomic environment and therefore, are more
susceptible to a short-term adverse economic change that could require an
impairment charge. The Company did not recognize any impairment charges for
goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets or intangible assets subject to
amortization during the years presented.

OTHER INFORMATION

Hedging and Derivative Financial Instruments

As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to
market risks such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and
commodity prices. To manage the volatility related to these exposures, we
evaluate our exposures on a global basis to take advantage of the netting
opportunities that exist. For the remaining exposures, we enter into various
derivative transactions in accordance with the Company's hedging policies that
are designed to offset, in-part or in-whole, changes in the underlying exposures
being hedged. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for
speculative trading purposes. Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
includes a detailed discussion of our accounting policies for financial
instruments.

Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuation,
sensitivity analysis and value-at-risk modeling. The tests for interest rate and
currency rate exposures discussed below are based on a Monte Carlo simulation
value-at-risk model using a one year horizon and a 95% confidence level. The
model incorporates the impact of correlation (exposures that tend to move in
tandem over time) and diversification from holding multiple currency and
interest rate instruments and assumes that financial returns are normally
distributed. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are
drawn from the RiskMetrics(TM) dataset as of June 30, 2004. In cases where data
is unavailable in RiskMetrics(TM), a reasonable proxy is included.

Our market risk exposures relative to interest and currency rates, as discussed
below, have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period. In
addition, we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
significantly impact such exposures in the near-term.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Interest Rate Exposure. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to
interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations. Certain rate swaps
denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency
exchange rate movements on the Company's investments in foreign operations.
These currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the Company's
foreign net investments.

Based on our overall interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended June
30, 2004, including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest
rates, we do not believe a near-term change in interest rates, at a 95%
confidence level based on historical interest rate movements, would materially
affect our financial statements.

Currency Rate Exposure. Because we manufacture and sell products in a number of
countries throughout the world, we are exposed to the impact on revenue and
expenses of movements in currency exchange rates. The primary purpose of the
Company's currency hedging activities is to reduce the risk that our financial
position will be adversely affected by short-term changes in exchange rates.
Corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. We
primarily use forward exchange contracts and purchased options with maturities
of less than 18 months.

In addition, we enter into certain currency swaps with maturities of up to five
years to hedge our exposure to exchange rate movements on intercompany financing
transactions. The Company also uses purchased currency options with maturities
of generally less than 18 months and forward exchange contracts to hedge against
the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany royalties and to offset
a portion of the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on income from
international operations.

Based on our overall currency rate exposure as of and during the year ended June
30, 2004, including derivative and other instruments sensitive to currency
movements, we do not believe a near-term change in currency rates, at a 95%
confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, would materially
affect our financial statements.

Commodity Price Exposure. We use raw materials that are subject to price
volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic
variables and other unpredictable factors. In addition to fixed price contracts,
we use futures, options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to
the above exposures. Commodity hedging activity is not considered material to
our financial statements.

Restructuring Program

In 1999, concurrent with a reorganization of our operations into product-based
Global Business Units, we initiated a multi-year restructuring program. Total
restructuring program charges were $538 million and $706 million after tax in
2003 and 2002, respectively. The program was substantially complete at the end
of June 2003 with a remaining reserve of $335 million. Substantially all of the
liability was settled through cash payments through June 30, 2004.

The Company continues to undertake projects to maintain a competitive cost
structure, including manufacturing consolidations and work force
rationalization, as part of its normal operations.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Our discussion of financial results includes several "non-GAAP" financial
measures. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional
information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some
of the metrics used to evaluate management. When used in MD&A, we have provided
the comparable GAAP measure in the discussion. These measures include:

Organic Sales Growth. Organic sales growth measures sales growth excluding the
impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year
comparisons. The Company believes this provides investors with a more complete
understanding of underlying results and trends by providing sales growth on a
consistent basis.

Free Cash Flow. Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital
spending. The Company views free cash flow as an important measure because it is
one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and
discretionary investment. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to
evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk
compensation.

Free Cash Flow Productivity. Free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio
of free cash flow to net earnings. The Company's target is to generate free cash
flow at or above 90% of net earnings. Free cash flow productivity is one of the
measures used to evaluate senior management.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

[DELOITTE LOGO]

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Procter & Gamble Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Procter &
Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June 30, 2004 and 2003 and
the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2004. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company at June 30, 2004 and
2003 and the results of its operations and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended June 30, 2004, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

40 The Procter & Gamble Company and Subsidiaries

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Operations

The Procter & Gamble Company's (the Company) business is focused on providing
consumer branded products of superior quality and value. The Company markets
approximately 300 consumer products in more than 160 countries around the world.
Our products are sold primarily through retail operations including mass
merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores and drug stores.

Basis of Presentation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include The Procter & Gamble Company and
its controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions are eliminated in
consolidation. Investments in certain companies over which the Company exerts
significant influence, but does not control the financial and operating
decisions, are accounted for as equity method investments.

Use of Estimates

Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. These
estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions
the Company may undertake in the future. Estimates are used in accounting for,
among other items, consumer and trade promotion accruals, pensions,
post-employment benefits, stock options, useful lives for depreciation and
amortization, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill
and long-lived assets, deferred tax assets, potential income tax assessments and
contingencies. Actual results may ultimately differ from estimates, although
management does not believe such changes would materially affect the financial
statements in any individual year.

Revenue Recognition

Sales are recognized when revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned.
Most revenue transactions represent sales of inventory, and the revenue recorded
includes shipping and handling costs, which generally are included in the list
price to the customer. The Company's policy is to recognize revenue when title
to the product, ownership and risk of loss transfer to the customer, which
generally is on the date of shipment. A provision for payment discounts and
product return allowances is recorded as a reduction of sales in the same period
that the revenue is recognized.

Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances,
merchandising funds and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs
to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending,
which is recognized as incurred, generally at the time of the sale. Most of
these arrangements have terms of approximately one year. Accruals for expected
payouts under these programs are included as accrued marketing and promotion in
the accrued and other current liabilities line in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets.

Cost of Products Sold

Cost of products sold primarily comprises direct materials and supplies consumed
in the manufacture of product, as well as manufacturing labor and direct
overhead expense necessary to acquire and convert the purchased materials and
supplies into finished product. Cost of products sold also includes the cost to
distribute products to customers, inbound freight costs, internal transfer
costs, warehousing costs and other shipping and handling activity. Shipping and
handling costs invoiced to customers are included in net sales.

Selling, General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative expense primarily includes marketing
expenses, including the cost of media, advertising and related costs; selling
expenses; research and development costs; administrative and other indirect
overhead costs; and other miscellaneous operating items.

Other Non-Operating Income, Net

Other non-operating income, net primarily includes interest and investment
income and gains and losses from divestitures.

Currency Translation

Financial statements of operating subsidiaries outside the United States of
America (U.S.) generally are measured using the local currency as the functional
currency. Adjustments to translate those statements into U.S. dollars are
recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI). For subsidiaries operating in
highly inflationary economies, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency.
Remeasurement adjustments for financial statements in highly inflationary
economies and other transactional exchange gains and losses are reflected in
earnings.

Cash Flow Presentation

The Statement of Cash Flows is prepared using the indirect method, which
reconciles net earnings to cash flow from operating activities. These
adjustments include the removal of timing differences between the occurrence of
operating receipts and payments and their recognition in net earnings. The
adjustments also remove from operating activities cash flows arising from
investing and financing activities, which are

presented separately from operating activities. Cash flows from foreign currency
transactions and operations are translated at an average exchange rate for the
period. Cash flows from hedging activities are included in the same category as
the items being hedged. Cash flows from derivative instruments designated as net
investment hedges are classified as financing activities. Cash flows from other
derivative instruments used to manage interest, commodity or currency exposures
are classified as operating activities. Cash paid for acquisitions is classified
as investing activities.

Cash Equivalents

Highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased
are considered cash equivalents and recorded at cost.

Investments

Investment securities consist of readily-marketable debt and equity securities.
These securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains or losses on
securities classified as trading are charged to earnings. Unrealized gains or
losses on securities classified as available for sale are recorded net of tax in
OCI.

Other investments that are not controlled and over which the Company does not
have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted under the cost
method.

Inventory Valuation

Inventories are valued at cost, which is not in excess of current market prices.
Product-related inventories are primarily maintained on the first-in, first-out
method. Minor amounts of product inventories, including certain cosmetics and
commodities are maintained on the last-in, first-out method. The cost of spare
part inventories is maintained using the average cost method.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The cost of intangible assets with determinable useful lives is amortized to
reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed, principally on a
straight-line basis over the estimated periods benefited. Goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangibles are not amortized, but are evaluated annually for
impairment. The Company evaluates a number of factors to determine whether an
indefinite life is appropriate, including the competitive environment, market
share, brand history, operating plan and the macroeconomic environment of the
country in which the brand is sold. Due to the nature of the Company's business,
there are a number of brand intangibles that have been determined to have
indefinite lives. If it is determined that a brand intangible does not have an
indefinite life, the Company's policy is to amortize such assets over the
expected useful life, which generally ranges from 5 to 20 years. Patents,
technology and other intangibles with contractual terms are amortized over their
respective contractual lives. Other non-contractual intangible assets with
determinable lives are amortized over periods ranging from 5 to 20 years.

Where certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, lives on
intangible assets with determinable lives may be adjusted and an impairment
assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts. The
annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles is
based on valuation models that incorporate internal projections of expected
future cash flows and operating plans.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost reduced by accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation expense is recognized over the assets' estimated
useful lives using the straight-line method. Machinery and equipment includes
office furniture and equipment (15-year life), computer equipment and
capitalized software (3 to 5-year lives) and manufacturing equipment (3 to
20-year lives). Buildings are depreciated over an estimated useful life of 40
years. Estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed and, where appropriate,
changes are made prospectively. Where certain events or changes in operating
conditions occur, asset lives may be adjusted and an impairment assessment may
be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

Certain financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value. The
estimated fair values of such financial instruments, including certain debt
instruments, investment securities and derivatives, have been determined using
market information and valuation methodologies, primarily discounted cash flow
analysis. These estimates require considerable judgment in interpreting market
data and changes in assumptions or estimation methods could significantly affect
the fair value estimates. However, the Company does not believe any such changes
would have a material impact on its financial condition or results of
operations. Other financial instruments, including cash equivalents, other
investments and short-term debt, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair
value. The fair valve of long-term debt is disclosed in Note 6.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company has employee stock option plans, which are described more fully in
Note 8. The Company accounts for its employee stock option plans under the
intrinsic value recognition and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles
Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and
related interpretations. As stock options have been issued with exercise prices
equal to the market value of the underlying shares on the grant date, no
compensation expense has resulted.

Had compensation expense for the plans been determined based on the fair value
of the options on the grant date, consistent with SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation," the Company's net earnings and earnings per common
share would have been as follows:

Stock Split

In March 2004, the Company's Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock
split effective for common and preferred shareholders of record as of May 21,
2004. The financial statements, notes and other references to share and per
share data have been restated to reflect the stock split for all periods
presented.

New Pronouncements and Reclassifications

No new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the fiscal year have
had or are expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.
Certain reclassifications of prior years' amounts have been made to conform to
the current year presentation.

NOTE 2 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM

In 1999, concurrent with a reorganization of its operations into product-based
Global Business Units, the Company initiated a multi-year restructuring program.
Costs included enrollment reductions, manufacturing consolidations and portfolio
choices to scale back or discontinue under-performing businesses and
initiatives. Total restructuring program charges were $751 in 2003, including
$351 in separations related to approximately 5,000 people, $190 in asset
write-downs and $87 in accelerated depreciation related to long-lived assets
that were taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period.
Total restructuring program charges were $958 in 2002, including $393 in
separations related to approximately 7,400 people, $208 in asset write-downs and
$135 in accelerated depreciation.

At June 30, 2003, the program was substantially complete with a remaining
reserve of $335. Substantially all of this liability was settled through cash
payments by the end of 2004.

The Company continues to undertake projects to maintain a competitive cost
structure, including manufacturing streamlining and work force rationalization,
as part of its normal operations.

NOTE 3 ACQUISITIONS AND SPIN-OFF

Wella Acquisition

On September 2, 2003, the Company acquired a controlling interest in Wella AG
(Wella). Through a stock purchase agreement with the majority shareholders of
Wella and a tender offer made on the remaining shares, the Company acquired a
total of 81% of Wella's outstanding shares, including 99% of Wella's outstanding
voting class shares. In June 2004, the Company and Wella entered into a
Domination and Profit Transfer Agreement (the Domination Agreement) pursuant to
which the Company is entitled to exercise full operating control and receive
100% of the future earnings of Wella. As consideration for the Domination
Agreement, the Company will pay the holders of the remaining outstanding shares
of Wella a guaranteed perpetual annual dividend payment. Alternatively, the
remaining Wella shareholders may elect to tender their shares to the Company for
an agreed price. The fair value of the total guaranteed annual dividend payments
is $1.11 billion, which approximates the cost if all remaining shares were
tendered. Because the Domination Agreement transfers operational and economic
control of the remaining outstanding shares to the Company, it has been
accounted for as an acquisition of the remaining shares, with a liability
recorded equal to the fair value of the guaranteed payments. Because of the
tender feature, the liability is recorded as a current liability in the accrued
and other liabilities

line of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Payments made under the guaranteed
annual dividend provisions will be allocated between interest expense and a
reduction of the liability, as appropriate. The total purchase price for Wella,
including acquisition costs, was $6.27 billion based on exchange rates at the
acquisition dates. It was funded with a combination of cash, debt and the
liability recorded under the Domination Agreement

The acquisition of Wella, with over $3 billion in annual net sales, gives the
Company access to the professional hair care category plus greater scale and
scope in hair care, hair colorants, cosmetics and fragrance products, while
providing potential for significant synergies. The operating results of the
Wella business are reported in the Company's Beauty Care business segment
beginning September 2, 2003.

The following table provides pro forma results of operations for the years ended
June 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002, as if Wella had been acquired as of the beginning
of each fiscal year presented. The pro forma results include certain
adjustments, including adjustments to convert Wella's historical financial
information from International Accounting Standards (IAS) into U.S. GAAP,
estimated interest impacts from funding of the acquisition and estimated
amortization of definite-lived intangible assets. However, pro forma results do
not include any anticipated cost savings or other effects of the integration of
Wella. Accordingly, such amounts are not necessarily indicative of the results
that would have occurred if the acquisition had occurred on the dates indicated
or that may result in the future.

The Company is in the process of finalizing independent appraisals for certain
assets to assist management in allocating the purchase price to the individual
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. This may result in adjustments to the
carrying values of Wella's recorded assets and liabilities, including the amount
of any residual value allocated to goodwill. The Company is also completing its
analysis of collaboration plans that may result in additional purchase price
allocation adjustments. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price
included in the current period balance sheet is based on the current best
estimates of management and is subject to revision based on final determination
of fair values and collaboration plans. The Company anticipates the valuations
and other studies will be completed prior to the anniversary date of the
acquisition. The preliminary allocation of the total purchase price of Wella
resulted in the following condensed balance sheet of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed.

The Wella acquisition resulted in $5.86 billion in goodwill, all of which was
allocated to the Beauty Care segment, and $1.71 billion in total intangible
assets acquired with $1.15 billion allocated to trademarks with indefinite
lives. The remaining $556 of acquired intangibles have determinable useful lives
and were assigned to trademarks of $267, patents and technology of $10,
professional customer relationships of $214 and license and other intangible
assets of $65. Total intangible assets acquired with determinable lives have a
weighted-average life of 11 years (8 years for trademarks, 5 years for patents
and technology, 15 years for professional customer relationships and 23 years
for license and other intangible assets).

China Venture

On June 18, 2004, the Company purchased the remaining 20% stake in its China
venture from its partner, Hutchison Whampoa China Ltd. (Hutchison), giving the
Company full ownership in its operations in China. The net purchase price was
$1.85 billion, which is the purchase price of $2.00 billion net of minority
interest and related obligations that were eliminated as a result of the
transaction. The acquisition was funded by debt. The fair value of the
incremental individual assets and liabilities acquired approximates current book
value. Accordingly, the purchase price was recorded as goodwill, which was
allocated to multiple business segments.

Jif and Crisco Spin-off

On May 31, 2002, the Jif peanut butter and Crisco shortening brands were spun
off to the Company's shareholders and subsequently merged into The J.M. Smucker
Company (Smucker). The Company's shareholders received one new common Smucker
share for every 50 shares held in the Company, totaling 26 million shares, or
approximately $900 in market value. This transaction was not included in the
results of operations, since a spin-off to the Company's shareholders is
recorded at net book value, or $150, in a manner similar to dividends.

Other minor business purchases and intangible asset acquisitions totaled $384,
$61 and $446 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

                                      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 7 RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, the Company is
exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange
rates and commodity pricing. To manage the volatility related to these
exposures, the Company evaluates exposures on a consolidated basis to take
advantage of logical exposure netting. For the remaining exposures, the Company
enters into various derivative transactions. Such derivative transactions, which
are executed in accordance with the Company's policies in areas such as
counterparty exposure and hedging practices, are accounted for under SFAS No.
133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended
and interpreted. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial
instruments for speculative trading purposes.

At inception, the Company formally designates and documents the financial
instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure. The Company formally
assesses, both at inception and at least quarterly on an ongoing basis, whether
the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at
offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the related
underlying exposure. Fluctuations in the derivative value generally are offset
by changes in the fair value or cash flows of the exposures being hedged. This
offset is driven by the high degree of effectiveness between the exposure being
hedged and the hedging instrument. Any ineffective portion of an instrument's
change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings.

Credit Risk

The Company has established strict counterparty credit guidelines and normally
enters into transactions with investment grade financial institutions.
Counterparty exposures are monitored daily and downgrades in credit rating are
reviewed on a timely basis. Credit risk arising from the inability of a
counterparty to meet the terms of the Company's financial instrument contracts
generally is limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparty's
obligations exceed the obligations of the Company. The Company does not expect
to incur material credit losses on its risk management or other financial
instruments.

Interest Rate Management

The Company's policy is to manage interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate
and variable-rate debt. To manage this risk in a cost efficient manner, the
Company enters into interest rate swaps in which the Company agrees to exchange,
at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest
amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.

Interest rate swaps that meet specific conditions under SFAS No. 133 are
accounted for as fair value hedges. Changes in the fair value of both the
hedging instruments and the underlying debt obligations are immediately
recognized in earnings as equal and offsetting gains and losses in the interest
expense component of the income statement. The fair value of the Company's
interest rate swap agreements was a net asset of $45 and $322 at June 30, 2004
and 2003, respectively. All existing fair value hedges are 100% effective. As a
result, there is no impact to earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness.

Foreign Currency Management

The Company manufactures and sells its products in a number of countries
throughout the world and, as a result, is exposed to movements in foreign
currency exchange rates. The purpose of the Company's foreign currency hedging
program is to reduce the risk caused by short-term changes in exchange rates.

The Company primarily utilizes forward exchange contracts and purchased options
with maturities of less than 18 months and currency swaps with maturities up to
5 years. These instruments are intended to offset the effect of exchange rate
fluctuations on forecasted sales, inventory purchases, intercompany royalties
and intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies and are therefore
accounted for as cash flow hedges. The fair value of these instruments at June
30, 2004 and June 30, 2003 was $47 and $27 in assets and $140 and $92 in
liabilities, respectively. The effective portion of the changes in fair value
for these instruments are reported in OCI and reclassified into earnings in the
same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during
which the hedged transactions affect earnings. The ineffective portion, which is
not material for any year presented, is immediately recognized in earnings.

Certain instruments used by the Company for foreign exchange risk do not meet
the requirements for hedge accounting treatment. In these cases, the change in
value of the instruments is designed to offset the foreign currency impact of
intercompany financing transactions, income from international operations and
other balance sheet revaluations. The fair value of these instruments at June
30, 2004 and 2003 was $71 and $113 in assets and $26 and $26 in liabilities,
respectively. The gain or loss on these instruments is immediately recognized in
earnings. The net impact of such instruments, included in selling, general and
administrative expense, was $80, $264 and $50 of gains in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, which substantially offset foreign currency transaction losses of
the items being hedged.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Net Investment Hedging

The Company hedges certain net investment positions in major currencies. To
accomplish this, the Company borrows directly in foreign currency and designates
a portion of foreign currency debt as a hedge of net investments in foreign
subsidiaries. In addition, certain foreign currency swaps are designated as
hedges of the Company's related foreign net investments. Under SFAS No. 133,
changes in the fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in
OCI, to offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged.
Currency effects of these hedges reflected in OCI were a $348 and $418 after-tax
loss in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Accumulated net balances were a $586
after-tax loss in 2004 and a $238 after-tax loss in 2003.

Commodity Price Management

Raw materials used by the Company are subject to price volatility caused by
weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other
unpredictable factors. To manage the volatility related to certain anticipated
inventory purchases, the Company uses futures and options with maturities
generally less than one year and swap contracts with maturities up to five
years. These market instruments are designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS
No. 133. Accordingly, the mark-to-market gain or loss on qualifying hedges is
reported in OCI and reclassified into cost of products sold in the same period
or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Qualifying cash
flow hedges currently recorded in OCI are not considered material. The
mark-to-market gain or loss on non-qualifying, excluded and ineffective portions
of hedges is immediately recognized in cost of products sold. Commodity hedging
activity was not material to the Company's financial statements for any of the
years presented.

NOTE 8 EARNINGS PER SHARE AND STOCK OPTIONS

Net Earnings Per Common Share

Net earnings less preferred dividends (net of related tax benefits) are divided
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year to
calculate basic net earnings per common share. Diluted net earnings per common
share are calculated to give effect to stock options and assuming conversion of
preferred stock (see Note 9).

Net earnings and common share balances used to calculate basic and diluted net
earnings per share were as follows:

(1)   Despite being included currently in diluted net earnings per common share,
      the actual conversion to common stock occurs pursuant to the repayment of
      the ESOP debt through 2021.

(2)   Approximately 38 million in 2004, 66 million in 2003 and 72 million in
      2002 of the Company's outstanding stock options were not included in the
      diluted net earnings per share calculation because to do so would have
      been antidilutive (i.e., the exercise price exceeded market value).

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company has a primary stock-based compensation plan under which stock
options are granted annually to key managers and directors with exercise prices
equal to the market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant. Grants
were made under plans approved by shareholders in 1992, 2001 and 2003. Grants
issued since September 2002 are vested after three years and have a ten-year
life. Grants issued from July 1998 through August 2002 are vested after three
years and have a fifteen-year life, while grants issued prior to July 1998 are
vested after one year and have a ten-year life. The Company also makes other
minor grants to employees, for which vesting terms and option lives are not
substantially different.

                                      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Had the provision of SFAS No. 123 expensing been applied, the Company's net
earnings and earnings per common share would have been impacted as summarized in
the discussion of the Company's stock-based compensation accounting policy in
Note 1. In calculating the impact for options granted, the Company has estimated
the fair value of each grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
Assumptions are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market
conditions and experience. The following assumptions were used:

The Company repurchases common shares to mitigate the dilutive impact of
options. Beyond that, the Company may make additional discretionary purchases
based on cash availability, market trends and other factors.

In limited cases, the Company also issues stock appreciation rights, generally
in countries where stock options are not permitted by local governments. The
obligations and associated compensation expense are adjusted for changes in
intrinsic value. The impact of these adjustments is not material.

NOTE 9 POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

The Company offers various postretirement benefits to its employees.

Defined Contribution Retirement Plans

The most prevalent employee benefit plans offered are defined contribution
plans, which cover substantially all employees in the U.S., as well as employees
in certain other countries. These plans are fully funded.

                                The Procter & Gamble Company and Subsidiaries 49

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Under the defined contribution plans, the Company generally makes contributions
to participants based on individual base salaries and years of service. In the
U.S., the contribution is set annually. Historically, the Company has
contributed approximately 15% of total participants' annual wages and salaries.

The Company maintains The Procter & Gamble Profit Sharing Trust (Trust) and
Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) to provide a portion of the funding for the
U.S. defined contribution plan, as well as other retiree benefits. Operating
details of the ESOP are provided at the end of this Note. The fair value of the
ESOP Series A shares reduces the Company's cash contribution required to fund
the U.S. defined contribution plan. Defined contribution expense, which
approximates the Company's cash contribution to the plan that is funded in the
subsequent year, was $274, $286 and $279 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Defined Benefit Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits

Certain other employees, primarily outside the U.S., are covered by local
defined benefit pension plans as well as other retiree benefit plans.

The Company also provides certain other retiree benefits, primarily health care
and life insurance, for substantially all U.S. employees who become eligible for
these benefits when they meet minimum age and service requirements. Generally,
the health care plans require cost sharing with retirees and pay a stated
percentage of expenses, reduced by deductibles and other coverages. These
benefits primarily are funded by ESOP Series B shares, as well as certain other
assets contributed by the Company.

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 was
signed into law on December 8, 2003. This Act introduces a Medicare
prescription-drug benefit beginning in 2006 as well as a federal subsidy to
sponsors of retiree health care plans that provide a benefit at least
"actuarially equivalent" to the Medicare benefit. Management has concluded that
the Company's plans are at least "actuarially equivalent" to the Medicare
benefit and, accordingly, has included the federal subsidy from the Act in the
normal year-end measurement process for other retiree benefit plans. The impact
is a reduction to the benefit obligation of $195 as of June 30, 2004. The impact
to net periodic pension cost and to benefits paid in future years is not
expected to be material.

Obligation and Funded Status. The Company uses a June 30 measurement date for
its defined benefit retirement plans and other retiree benefit plans. The
following provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations, plan assets and
funded status of these plans:

The underfunding of pension benefits is primarily a function of the different
funding incentives that exist outside of the U.S. In certain countries where the
Company has major operations, there are no legal requirements or financial
incentives provided to companies to pre-fund pension obligations. In these
instances, benefit payments are typically paid directly from the Company's cash
as they become due, rather than through the creation of a separate pension fund.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit retirement plans was
$3,822 and $2,850 at June 30, 2004 and June 30, 2003, respectively. Plans with
accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets and plans with
projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as of June 30, consist of
the following:

Assumptions. The Company determines its actuarial assumptions on an annual
basis. These assumptions are weighted to reflect each country that may have an
impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits. The weighted-average
assumptions for the defined benefit and other retiree benefit calculations, as
well as assumed health care cost trend rates, for the years ended June 30, are
as follows:

(1) Determined as of end of year.

(2) Determined as of beginning of year.

(3) Rate is applied to current plan costs net of Medicare; estimate initial rate
    for "gross eligible charges" (charges inclusive of Medicare) is 7.7% for
    2004 and 8.8% for 2003.

Several factors are considered in developing the estimate for the long-term
expected rate of return on plan assets. For the defined benefit plans, these
include historical rates of return of broad equity and bond indices and
projected long-term rates of return from pension investment consultants. The
expected long-term rates of return for plan assets are 8%-9% for equities and
5%-6% bonds. The rate of return on other retiree benefit plan assets, comprised
primarily of Company stock, is based on the long-term projected return of 9.5%
and reflects the historical pattern of favorable returns on the Company's stock
relative to broader market indices (e.g., S&P 500).

Assumed health care cost trend rates could have a significant effect on the
amounts reported for the other retiree benefit plans. A one-percentage point
change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:

                                      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company's investment objective for defined benefit plan assets is to meet
the plans' benefit obligations, while minimizing the potential for future
required Company plan contributions. The investment strategies focus on asset
class diversification, liquidity to meet benefit payments and an appropriate
balance of long-term investment return and risk. Target ranges for asset
allocations are determined by matching the actuarial projections of the plans'
future liabilities and benefit payments with expected long-term rates of return
on the assets, taking into account investment return volatility and correlations
across asset classes. Plan assets are diversified across several investment
managers and are generally invested in liquid funds that are selected to track
broad market equity and bond indices. Investment risk is carefully controlled
with plan assets rebalanced to target allocations on a periodic basis and
continual monitoring of investment managers performance relative to the
investment guidelines established with each investment manager.

Cash Flows. Management's best estimate of its cash requirements for the defined
benefit plans and other retiree benefit plans for the year ending June 30, 2005
is $237 and $20, respectively. For the defined benefit plans, this is comprised
of expected benefit payments of $71, which are paid directly to participants of
unfunded plans from employer assets, as well as expected contributions to funded
plans of $166. For other retiree benefit plans, this is comprised of expected
contributions that will be used directly for benefit payments. Expected
contributions are dependent on many variables, including the variability of the
market value of the assets as compared to the obligation and other market or
regulatory conditions. In addition, the Company takes into consideration its
business investment opportunities and resulting cash requirements. Accordingly,
actual funding may differ greatly from current estimates.

Total benefit payments expected to be paid to participants, which include
payments funded from the Company's assets, as discussed above, as well as
payments paid from the plans are as follows:

Employee Stock Ownership Plan

The Company maintains the ESOP to provide funding for certain employee benefits
discussed in the preceding paragraphs.

The ESOP borrowed $1.00 billion in 1989 and the proceeds were used to purchase
Series A ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock to fund a portion of the
defined contribution retirement plan in the U.S. Principal and interest
requirements were paid by the Trust from dividends on the preferred shares and
from advances from the Company. The final payment for the original borrowing of
$1.00 billion was made in 2004 and the remaining debt of the ESOP consists of
amounts owed to the Company. Each share is convertible at the option of the
holder into one share of the Company's common stock. The dividend for the
current year was $0.93 per share. The liquidation value is $6.82 per share.

In 1991, the ESOP borrowed an additional $1.00 billion. The proceeds were used
to purchase Series B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock to fund a portion
of retiree health care benefits. These shares are considered plan assets, net of
the associated debt, of the Other Retiree Benefits plan discussed above. Debt
service requirements are funded by preferred stock dividends and cash
contributions from the Company. Each share is convertible at the option of the
holder into one share of the Company's common stock. The dividend for the
current year was $1.02 per share. The liquidation value is $12.96 per share.

Employee Stock Ownership Plans," the Company has elected, where applicable, to
continue its practices, which are based on SOP 76-3, "Accounting Practices for
Certain Employee Stock Ownership Plans." ESOP debt, which is guaranteed by the
Company, is recorded as debt (see Note 6). Preferred shares issued to the ESOP
are offset by the reserve for ESOP debt retirement in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets and the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity. Interest
incurred on the ESOP debt is recorded as interest expense. Dividends on all
preferred shares, net of related tax benefits, are charged to retained earnings.

</TABLE>

For purposes of calculating diluted net earnings per common share, the preferred
shares held by the ESOP are considered converted from inception. Diluted net
earnings are calculated assuming that all preferred shares are converted to
common, and therefore are adjusted to reflect the incremental ESOP funding that
would be required due to the difference in dividend rate between preferred and
common shares (see Note 8).

NOTE 10 INCOME TAXES

Under SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," income taxes are recognized
for the amount of taxes payable for the current year and for the impact of
deferred tax liabilities and assets, which represent future tax consequences of
events that have been recognized differently in the financial statements than
for tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established using the
enacted statutory tax rates and are adjusted for changes in such rates in the
period of change. Earnings before income taxes consisted of the following:

</TABLE>

The Company's effective income tax rate was 30.7%, 31.1% and 31.8% in 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively, compared to the U.S. statutory rate of 35.0%. The
country mix impacts of foreign operations reduced the Company's effective tax
rate to a larger degree in 2004 than the previous fiscal years: 4.1% in 2004,
3.8% in 2003 and 3.1% in 2002. The Company's higher effective tax rate in 2002
also reflected the impact of restructuring costs. Taxes impacted shareholders'
equity with credits of $351 and $361 for the years ended June 30, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. These primarily relate to the tax effects of net investment hedges
and tax benefits from the exercise of stock options.

The Company has undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of $16.75 billion
at June 30, 2004, for which deferred taxes have not been provided. Such earnings
are considered indefinitely invested in the foreign subsidiaries. If such
earnings were repatriated, additional tax expense may result, although the
calculation of such additional taxes is not practicable.

NOTE 11 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Guarantees

In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, the Company
may provide routine indemnifications (e.g., retention of previously existing
environmental, tax and employee liabilities) whose terms range in duration and
often are not explicitly defined. Generally, the maximum obligation under such
indemnifications is not explicitly stated and, as a result, the overall amount
of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than obligations
recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, historically the Company has
not made significant payments for these indemnifications. The Company believes
that if it were to incur a loss in any of these matters, the loss would not have
a material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

In certain situations, the Company guarantees loans for suppliers and customers.
The total amount of guarantees issued under such arrangements is not material.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company does not have off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including
variable interest entities, under FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities," that have a material impact on the financial
statements.

Purchase Commitments

The Company has purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services and
property, plant and equipment as part of the normal course of business. Due to
the proprietary nature of many of the Company's materials and processes, certain
supply contracts contain penalty provisions for early termination. The Company
does not expect potential payments under these provisions to materially affect
results of operations or its financial condition in any individual year.

Operating Leases

The Company leases certain property and equipment for varying periods under
operating leases. Future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable
operating leases are as follows: 2005 - $186; 2006 - $150; 2007 - $134; 2008 -
$99; 2009 - $86; and $265 thereafter.

Litigation

The Company is subject to various lawsuits and claims with respect to matters
such as governmental regulations, income taxes and other actions arising out of
the normal course of business. The Company is also subject to contingencies
pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require
the Company to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior
manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Accrued environmental liabilities
for remediation and closure costs were $36 and $34 at June 30, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Current year expenditures were not material.

While considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and Company
counsel, the ultimate liabilities resulting from such lawsuits and claims will
not materially affect the Company's financial condition.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 12 SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company is organized into five product-based Global Business Units. The
segments, which are generally determined by the product type and end-point user
benefits offered, manufacture and market products as follows:

- -     Fabric and Home Care includes laundry detergents, dish care, fabric
      enhancers and surface cleaners.

- -     Beauty Care includes retail and professional hair care, skin care,
      feminine care, cosmetics, fine fragrances and personal cleansing.

- -     Baby and Family Care includes diapers, baby wipes, bath tissue and kitchen
      towels.

- -     Health Care includes oral care, personal health care, pharmaceuticals and
      pet health and nutrition.

- -     Snacks and Beverages includes coffee, snacks, commercial services and
      juice. In August 2004, the Company divested the juice business.

Effective July 1, 2004, the Company realigned its businesses and associated
management responsibilities to three business units: Beauty Care; Health, Baby
and Family Care; and Household Care, which will include the current Fabric and
Home Care business as well as the Snacks and Beverages business.

The accounting policies of the operating segments are generally the same as
those described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
Differences from these policies and U.S. GAAP primarily reflect: income taxes,
which are reflected in the business segments using estimated local statutory
rates; the recording of fixed assets at historical exchange rates in certain
high inflation economies; and the treatment of unconsolidated investees.
Unconsolidated investees are managed as integral parts of the Company's business
units for management and segment reporting purposes. Accordingly, these
partially owned operations are reflected as consolidated subsidiaries in segment
results, with 100% recognition of the individual income statement line items
through before-tax earnings, while after-tax earnings are adjusted to reflect
only the Company's ownership percentage. Entries to eliminate the individual
revenues and expenses, adjusting the method of accounting to the equity method
as required by U.S. GAAP, are included in Corporate.

Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities that are not
reflected in the operating results used internally to measure and evaluate the
operating segments, as well as eliminations to adjust management reporting
principles to U.S. GAAP. Operating activities in Corporate include the results
of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level along with the
elimination of individual revenues and expenses generated by companies over
which the Company exerts significant influence, but does not control. Operating
elements also comprise intangible asset amortization, certain employee benefit
costs and other general corporate items. The non-operating elements include
financing and investing activities. In addition, Corporate includes the
historical results of certain divested businesses of the former Food and
Beverage segment. Corporate assets primarily include cash, investment
securities, goodwill and other non-current intangible assets.

The Company had net sales in the U.S. of $23,688, $21,853 and $21,198 for the
years ended June 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Assets in the U.S.
totaled $23,687 and $23,424 as of June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The Company's largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates,
accounted for 17%, 18% and 17% of consolidated net sales in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. These sales occurred primarily in the U.S.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1.    Binders are subject to confirmation that any excess follow form layer does

2.    All other terms and conditions are as per Starr's Excess Liability Policy
      Form STARR DO (07/00) shortform and endorsements referenced above.

3.    The above binder does not include any amount with respect to Insurance
      Premium Tax. The terms of our proposal include the obligation of the

      with respect to the premiums received from the Insured. We require this
      information no later than thirty (30) days after binding.

4.    As respects UKWT, we are unable to determine what UKIPT, if any, is due.

      same, the Insured shall be responsible to the UK authorities for any UXIPT
      monies and penalties due.

5.    Please advise your client that we cannot release policy documentation
      without receipt of the required signed Followed Policy. If we do not have
      a signed and completed policy we will not issue our policy documentation.
      Once the Followed Policy is received, our policy will be issued as soon as
      possible. In addition, please note and inform your client that the
      provisions of this binder and the subsequent binding contract require
      copies of all underlying policies and applicable endorsements to be
      supplied to this office.

6.    In the event any Underlying Policy contains terms and conditions more
      restrictive than the Followed Policy, then the Insurer's coverage shall
      under no circumstances be broader than the most restrictive terms and
      conditions contained in any Underlying Policy.

      Excess International Liability Insurance Company Ltd. and shall be
      automatically cancelled and superceded by such binder(s)/policy(ies) upon
      issuance.

9.    Except to such extent as may otherwise be provided herein, the coverage of
      this binder is limited generally to liability for only those claims that
      are first made against the insureds during the policy period and reported
      in writing to the insurer pursuant to the terms of this binder. Please
