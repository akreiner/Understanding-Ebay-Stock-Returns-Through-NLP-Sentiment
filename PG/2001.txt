<P align="left">Item&nbsp;1. <B>Business.</B>

<P align="center"><B>General Development of Business</B>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Procter &#38; Gamble Company was incorporated in Ohio in 1905, having been
built from a business founded in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble.
Today, the Company manufactures and markets a broad range of consumer products
in many countries throughout the world.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the context indicates otherwise, the term the &#147;Company&#148; as used
herein refers to The Procter &#38; Gamble Company (the registrant) and its
subsidiaries.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, the Company announced its intention to transition from its
previous geographic-based structure to a product-based global business unit
structure. Concurrent with that change, the Company initiated its Organization
2005 restructuring program, a discussion of which is incorporated herein by
reference to Note 2, Restructuring Program, which appears on pages 27-28 of the
Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30, 2001.
Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by
reference to the Letter to Shareholders, which appears on pages 1-3 of the
Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30, 2001.

<P align="center"><B>Financial Information About Industry Segments</B>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s products fall into five business segments: fabric and home
care, paper, beauty care, health care, and food and beverage.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by
reference to Note 12, Segment Information, of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, which appears on page 34, and Financial Review, which
appears on pages 10-19 of the Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year
ended June&nbsp;30, 2001.

<P align="center"><B>Narrative Description of Business</B>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s business, represented by the aggregate of its fabric and
home care, paper, beauty care, health care, and food and beverage segments, is
essentially homogeneous. Many of the factors necessary for an understanding of
these five segments are essentially identical. The markets in which the
Company&#146;s products are sold are highly competitive. The products of the
Company&#146;s business segments compete with many large and small companies, and
there is no dominant competitor or competitors. Advertising is used in
conjunction with an extensive sales force because the Company believes this
combination provides the most efficient method of marketing these types of
products. Product quality, performance, value and packaging are also important
competitive factors. Most of the Company&#146;s products in each of its segments
are distributed through food, drug, mass and other retail outlets.

<H5 align="left"><A HREF="#toc">Table of Contents</A></H5><P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laundry and diaper categories constitute approximately 20% and 12% of
consolidated fiscal 2001 sales, respectively. These results are comparable to
the year before. The creation of new products and the development of new
performance benefits for consumers on the Company&#146;s existing products are vital
ingredients in its continuing progress in the highly competitive markets in
which it does business. Basic research and product development activities
continued to carry a high priority during the past fiscal year. While many of
the benefits from these efforts will not be realized until future years, the
Company believes these activities demonstrate its commitment to future growth.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has registered trademarks and owns or has licenses under
patents which are used in connection with its business in all segments. Some
of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and
processing of the Company&#146;s products. The trademarks of all major products in
each segment are registered. In part, the Company&#146;s success can be attributed
to the existence of these trademarks, patents and licenses.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the raw materials used by the Company are purchased from others.
Additionally, some raw materials, primarily chemicals, are produced by the
Company for further use in the manufacturing process. The Company purchases
and produces a substantial variety of raw materials, no one of which is
material to the Company&#146;s business taken as a whole.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditures in fiscal year 2001 for compliance with federal, state and
local environmental laws and regulations were not materially different from
such expenditures in the prior year, and no material increase is expected in
fiscal year 2002.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operations outside the United States are generally characterized by the
same conditions discussed in the description of the business above and may also
be affected by additional elements including changing currency values and
different rates of inflation and economic growth.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has approximately 106,000 employees. The decline of
approximately 4,000 employees versus the prior year is primarily due to the
Company&#146;s restructuring program.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by
reference to Note 12, Segment Information, which appears on page 34; Financial
Summary, which appears on page 35; and Financial Review, which appears on pages
10-19 of the Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30,
2001.

<P align="center"><B>Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations</B>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference
to Note 12, Segment Information, which appears on page 34, and Financial
Review, which appears on pages 10-19 of the Annual Report to Shareholders for
the fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30, 2001. Company sales by geography for the fiscal
year ended June&nbsp;30, 2001 were as follows: North America &#151; 55%; Europe, Middle
East and Africa &#151; 27%; Asia &#151; 10% and Latin America &#151; 8%.

<P align="left">Item&nbsp;5. <B>Market for the Common Stock and Related Stockholder Matters</B>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information required by this item is incorporated by reference to
Shareholder Information, which appears on the inside back cover of the Annual
Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30, 2001.

<P align="left">Item&nbsp;6. <B>Selected Financial Data</B>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information required by this item is incorporated by reference to
Financial Summary, which appears on page 35 of the Annual Report to
Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30, 2001.

<P align="left">Item&nbsp;7. <B>Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations</B>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information required by this item is incorporated by reference to
Financial Review, which appears on pages 10-19; Note 2, Restructuring Program,
which appears on pages 27-28; Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, which
appears on page 33; Note 12, Segment Information, which appears on page 34 of
the Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30, 2001; and
the Company&#146;s Current Report on Form&nbsp;8-K dated August&nbsp;15, 2001.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has made and will make certain forward-looking statements in
the Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30, 2001 and
in other contexts relating to volume growth, increases in market shares,
Organization 2005, financial goals and cost reduction, among others.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and estimates
regarding competitive activity, pricing, product introductions, economic
conditions, technological innovation, currency movements, governmental action
and the development of certain markets. Among the key factors necessary to
achieve the Company&#146;s goals are: (1)&nbsp;the successful execution of Organization
2005 within the Company&#146;s planned timing, including achievement of expected
cost and tax savings and successful management of organizational and work
process restructuring; (2)&nbsp;the ability to achieve business plans, including
volume growth and pricing plans, despite high levels of competitive activity,
especially with respect to the product categories and geographical markets in
which the Company has chosen to focus; (3)&nbsp;the ability to maintain key customer
relationships; (4)&nbsp;the achievement of growth in significant developing markets
such as China, Korea, Mexico, the Southern Cone of Latin America and the
countries of Central and Eastern Europe; (5)&nbsp;the ability to successfully manage
regulatory, tax and legal matters, including resolution of pending matters
within current estimates; (6)&nbsp;the successful and timely execution of planned
brand divestitures; (7)&nbsp;the ability to successfully implement cost improvement
plans in manufacturing and overhead areas; (8)&nbsp;the timely execution of
definitive agreements and the receipt of timely and successful regulatory
clearances with respect to a potential transaction with The Coca-Cola Company;
(9)&nbsp;the timely and successful receipt of regulatory clearances and subsequent
successful integration of the Clairol business; and (10)&nbsp;the ability to
successfully manage currency, interest rate and certain commodity cost
exposures. If the Company&#146;s assumptions and estimates are incorrect or do not
come to fruition, or if the Company does not achieve all of these key factors,
then the Company&#146;s actual performance could vary materially from the
forward-looking statements made herein.

                           STOCK AND ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT dated as of May
                  20, 2001 (this "AGREEMENT"), between BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB
                  COMPANY, a Delaware corporation ("SELLER"), and THE PROCTER &
                  GAMBLE COMPANY, an Ohio corporation ("BUYER").

         Buyer desires to purchase from Seller, and Seller desires to sell to
Buyer, all the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, par value $10 per
share (the "CLAIROL SHARES"), of Clairol Incorporated, a Delaware corporation
and wholly owned subsidiary of Seller (the "COMPANY")

         Buyer also desires to purchase from the subsidiaries of Seller set

CLAIROL SUBSIDIARY").

          Seller's customer management organization in the United States (the
"CMO") distributes and sells products of the Company, together with products of
other businesses of Seller and its Affiliates. Buyer and Seller desire that
Buyer acquire all Seller's CMO business and operations and that, following such

such assets and certain other assets related to the provision of such services
and assume certain liabilities related thereto. Accordingly, Buyer desires to

         Entities desire to sell to Buyer, the Other U.S. Acquired Assets. Buyer
desires to assume, and Seller and the U.S. Asset Selling Entities desire to
assign, the Other U.S. Assumed Liabilities.

         Seller and certain of its subsidiaries set forth in Exhibit B-2 (each,
an "INTERNATIONAL ASSET SELLING ENTITY") manufacture, market, distribute or sell
the products of the Acquired Business (other than the CMO) or otherwise have
assets or liabilities of the Acquired Business (other than the CMO) in each of
the corresponding countries set forth in Exhibit B-2. Buyer desires to acquire,
or to cause its designated Buyer Subsidiaries to acquire, from Seller and the
Asset Selling Entities, and Seller desires to transfer, and to cause the Asset
Selling Entities to transfer, to Buyer and its designated Buyer Subsidiaries,
the International Acquired Assets. Buyer desires to assume, and Seller desires
to assign, the International Assumed Liabilities.

         Buyer desires to hire certain employees associated with the Acquired
Business, as set forth in this Agreement and the Other Transaction Documents.

         Section 15.07(c) identifies the Sections of this Agreement in which
capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined.

         Accordingly, Seller and Buyer hereby agree as follows:

Selling Entities to, sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver to Buyer or its
designated Buyer Subsidiaries, and Buyer will purchase or cause such Buyer

U.S. Acquired Assets and (iv) Seller will, and will cause the International
Asset Selling Entities to, sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver to Buyer

after the Six Month Anniversary, interest on the Purchase Price accrued from the
Six Month Anniversary to the Closing Date at the Prime Rate, payable and subject
to adjustment as set forth in Article II, and (B) the assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities. The purchase and sale of the Clairol Shares, the International
Shares, the U.S. Acquired Assets and the International Acquired Assets and the
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities is referred to in this Agreement,
collectively, as the "TRANSACTION".

         (b) The purchase and sale of the International Shares with respect to
each International Clairol Subsidiary will be effected pursuant to short-form
stock purchase agreements (each, an "INTERNATIONAL STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT") in
substantially the same form as the form of International Stock Purchase
Agreement attached as Exhibit C to this Agreement, except (as Buyer and Seller
shall reasonably agree) for (i) the deletion of provisions which are
inapplicable to such International Clairol Subsidiary, (ii) such changes as may
be necessary to satisfy the requirements of applicable local law, (iii) such
changes as may be reasonably agreed upon by Seller and Buyer regarding employees
and employee benefits matters in order to adapt such agreement to the particular
circumstances of the relevant International Clairol Subsidiary and country or
countries in which it operates, provided that such changes shall be consistent
with the principles underlying the corresponding provisions of this Agreement
and (iv) such other changes as may be agreed by Seller and Buyer.

         (c) The transfer of each International Business Unit (including the
International Acquired Assets and International Assumed Liabilities) will be
effected pursuant to short-form asset purchase agreements (the "INTERNATIONAL
ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS") on a country-by-country basis. Each International

                                                                               4

substantially the same form as the form of International Asset Purchase
Agreement attached as Exhibit D, except (as Buyer and Seller shall reasonably
agree) for (i) the deletion of provisions which are inapplicable to such
International Business Unit, (ii) such changes as may be necessary to satisfy
the requirements of applicable local law, (iii) such changes as may be
reasonably agreed upon by Seller and Buyer regarding employees and employee
benefits matters in order to adapt such agreement to the particular
circumstances of the relevant International Business Unit and country, provided
that such changes shall be consistent with the terms and conditions of, and
principles underlying, the corresponding provisions of this Agreement, and (iv)
such other changes as may be agreed by Seller and Buyer.

         (d) Buyer and Seller agree to allocate a portion of the Purchase Price
(as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.02) to the International Shares and the
Acquired Assets in accordance with Exhibit E, and the remainder of the Purchase
Price (as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.02) to the Clairol Shares, in each case
in accordance with Section 12.05. Buyer and Seller shall further agree on the
allocation of the Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.02) with
respect to the Acquired Assets on a country-by-country or asset-by-asset basis.
A proposed Exhibit E shall be prepared by Seller and delivered to Buyer not
later than 30 days prior to Closing and Buyer and Seller shall reach agreement
on a final Exhibit E no later than 120 days after the Closing Date. If Buyer and
Seller are unable to reach agreement on a final Exhibit E by the end of such
120-day period, either party may refer any items of disagreement to the
Accounting Firm for resolution within 45 days of the receipt of such submission
using procedures comparable to those provided in Section 2.02(a)(iii).

         SECTION 1.02. ASSUMPTION OF THE ASSUMED LIABILITIES. On the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Buyer shall, on the Closing Date,
assume and shall pay, honor, perform and discharge (or cause to be assumed,
paid, honored, performed and discharged) when due all the U.S. Assumed
Liabilities and the International Assumed Liabilities (collectively, the
"ASSUMED LIABILITIES").

         SECTION 1.03. CONSENTS OF THIRD PARTIES. (a) Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement to assign any asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising under
or resulting from such asset if an attempted assignment thereof,
<PAGE>   13

                                                                               5

without the consent of a third party, would constitute a breach or other
contravention of the rights of such third party, would be ineffective with
respect to any party to an agreement concerning such asset, or would in any way
adversely affect the rights of Seller or the Seller Entities or, upon transfer,
Buyer or its designated Buyer Subsidiary under such asset. If any transfer or
assignment by Seller or any Seller Entity to, or any assumption by Buyer or its
designated Buyer Subsidiary of, any interest in, or liability, obligation or
commitment under, any asset requires the consent of a third party, then such
assignment or assumption shall be made subject to such consent being obtained.

           (b) If any such consent is not obtained prior to the Closing, Seller
and the Seller Entities, on the one hand, and Buyer and the Buyer Subsidiaries,
on the other hand, shall cooperate (at their own expense) in any lawful and
commercially reasonable arrangement reasonably proposed by Buyer under which (i)
Buyer or its designated Buyer Subsidiary shall obtain (without infringing upon
the legal rights of such third party or outside party or violating any
Applicable Law) the economic claims, rights and benefits (net of the amount of
any related Tax costs imposed on Seller and its Affiliates) under the asset,
claim or right with respect to which the consent has not been obtained in
accordance with this Agreement, and (ii) Buyer shall assume any related economic
burden (including the amount of any related Tax costs imposed on Seller and its

(or waived in writing by Buyer), (y) any of the conditions set forth in Section
3.02 shall not have been satisfied (or waived

                                                                               6

in writing by Seller) or (z) any statute, rule, regulation, executive order,
decree, temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or
other similar legal restraint or prohibition or other order enacted, entered,
promulgated, enforced or issued by any U.S. Governmental Entity shall be in
effect that prevents the purchase and sale of the Clairol Shares, then the
Closing shall occur no later than the second business day after the satisfaction
of such conditions or the termination of such restraint or prohibition, as
applicable. The Closing shall be held on the Closing Date at 10:00 a.m. at the
offices of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, Worldwide Plaza, 825 Eighth Avenue, New
York, New York. The date on which the Closing shall occur is hereinafter
referred to as the "Closing Date."

         (b) At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Seller, by wire transfer to
a bank account designated in writing by Seller at least two business days prior
to the Closing Date, immediately available funds in an amount equal to the sum
of (i) the Purchase Price plus or minus (ii) an estimate, prepared by Seller and
delivered to Buyer at least two business days prior to the Closing Date, of any
adjustment to the Purchase Price under Section 2.02(b) plus (iii) any interest
payable to Seller pursuant to Section 1.01(a). The Purchase Price plus or minus
such estimate of any such adjustment under Section 2.02(b) is hereinafter called
the "CLOSING DATE AMOUNT".

         (c) Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer certificates
representing the Clairol Shares, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by stock
powers duly endorsed in blank in proper form for transfer, with appropriate
transfer stamps, if any, affixed.

         (d) Seller (acting as agent for the International Stock Selling
Entities) shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer or its designated
Buyer Subsidiary with respect to each International Clairol Subsidiary (i)
certificates representing the International Shares for such International
Clairol Subsidiary, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by stock powers duly
endorsed in blank in proper form for transfer, with appropriate transfer stamps,
if any, affixed, or other appropriate instruments sufficient to evidence the

jurisdiction, and (ii) an appropriately executed International Stock Purchase
Agreement for each such International Clairol Subsidiary. Buyer shall deliver,
or cause its designated Buyer Subsidiary to deliver, to Seller

                                                                               7

(acting as agent for the International Stock Selling Entities) an appropriately
executed International Stock Purchase Agreement for each International Clairol
Subsidiary.

         (e)(i) Seller (acting for itself and as agent for the Asset Selling
Entities) shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer or its designated
Buyer Subsidiary such appropriately executed instruments of sale, assignment,
transfer and conveyance (including its counterpart signature page to each
applicable International Asset Purchase Agreement) in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Seller and their respective counsel
evidencing and effecting the sale, assignment, and transfer to Buyer or
designated Buyer Subsidiaries of the U.S. Acquired Assets and the International
Acquired Assets (collectively, the "ACQUIRED ASSETS") (it being understood that
such instruments shall not require the Seller or, as the case may be, the Asset
Selling Entities to make any additional representations, warranties or
covenants, expressed or implied, not contained in this Agreement) and (ii) Buyer
shall deliver or cause to be delivered by its applicable Buyer Subsidiaries to
Seller appropriately executed counterparts to such instruments of sale,
assignment, transfer and conveyance (including its counterpart signature page to
each applicable International Asset Purchase Agreement), and appropriately
executed instruments of assumption (it being understood that such instruments
described above shall not require Buyer or, as the case may be, Buyer
Subsidiaries, to make any additional representations, warranties or covenants,
expressed or implied, or assume any additional liabilities, expressed or
implied, not contained in this Agreement) by Buyer or its applicable Buyer
Subsidiaries of the Assumed Liabilities, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer, Seller and their respective counsel. The documents and
instruments referred to in Section 2.01(c), (d) and (e), together with the
International Stock Purchase Agreements and the International Asset Purchase
Agreements, are collectively referred to herein as the "TRANSFER DOCUMENTS".

         SECTION 2.02. PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT. (a) (i) Within 90 days after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a statement (the
"WORKING CAPITAL STATEMENT"), setting forth Working Capital as of the close of
business on the Closing Date ("CLOSING WORKING CAPITAL"). The Working Capital
Statement is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "STATEMENT". The Statement
shall be accompanied by a certificate of Buyer stating that the Statement has
been
<PAGE>   16

                                                                               8

prepared in compliance with the applicable requirements of this Section 2.02.

         (ii) The Statement shall become final and binding on the parties on the
sixtieth day following receipt thereof by the Seller, unless Seller gives
written notice of its disagreement with the Statement (a "NOTICE OF
DISAGREEMENT") to Buyer prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall (A)
specify in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so asserted and (B)
only include disagreements based on mathematical errors or based on Closing
Working Capital not being calculated in accordance with this Section 2.02. If a
Notice of Disagreement is received by Buyer in a timely manner, then the
Statement (as revised in accordance with clause (1) or (2) below) shall become
final and binding upon Seller and Buyer, on the earlier of (1) the date Seller
and Buyer resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to the
matters specified in such Notice of Disagreement and (2) the date all disputed
matters specified in such Notice of Disagreement are finally resolved in writing
by the Accounting Firm.

         (iii) During the 60-day period following the delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement, Seller and Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing
any differences which they may have with respect to the matters specified in
such Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such 60-day period, Seller and Buyer
shall submit to an internationally recognized independent accounting firm
mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyer (the "ACCOUNTING FIRM") for review and
resolution of any and all matters which remain in dispute and which were
properly included in such Notice of Disagreement. The scope of the Accounting
Firm's review shall be limited to only those matters which remain in dispute and
which were properly included in such Notice of Disagreement. Seller and Buyer
shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to render a decision
resolving the matters submitted to the Accounting Firm within 45 days of the
receipt of such submission. Seller and Buyer agree that judgment may be entered
upon the determination of the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction
over the party against which such determination is to be enforced. The
Accounting Firm's determination shall be accompanied by a certificate of the
Accounting Firm that it reached its decision in accordance with the provisions
of this Section 2.02(a). The cost of any arbitration (including the fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm) with respect to any Notice of Disagreement
pursuant to
<PAGE>   17

                                                                               9

this Section 2.02(a) shall be borne by Buyer and Seller in inverse proportion as
they may prevail on matters resolved by the Accounting Firm with respect to such
Notice of Disagreement, which proportionate allocation also shall be determined
by the Accounting Firm at the time the determination of the Accounting Firm is
rendered on the merits of the matter submitted.

           (b) (i) The Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount by which
Closing Working Capital exceeds $164,900,000 (the "W.C. AMOUNT"), and the
Purchase Price shall be decreased by the amount by which Closing Working Capital
is less than the W.C. Amount (the Purchase Price as so increased or decreased
shall hereinafter be referred to as the "ADJUSTED CLOSING DATE AMOUNT"). If the
Closing Date Amount is less than the Adjusted Closing Date Amount, Buyer shall,
and if the Closing Date Amount is greater than the Adjusted Closing Date Amount,
Seller shall, within 10 business days after the Working Capital Statement
becomes final and binding on the parties, make payment by wire transfer in
immediately available funds of the amount of such difference, together with
interest thereon accrued from the Closing Date to the date of payment at the
Prime Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.02(b), no
adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 2.02(b) shall be made
unless such adjustment (whether an increase or a decrease) would exceed
$12,500,000, and if the adjustment would exceed such amount, then the full
amount of the adjustment shall be made.

           (ii) The term "WORKING CAPITAL" shall mean Current Assets minus
Current Liabilities. The W.C. Amount equals Working Capital on December 31,
2000, as reflected in the Clairol Balance Sheet, the Boclaro Working Capital
Statement and the CMO Working Capital Statement, and shall not be subject to
change regardless of whether the items included therein were in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles or the Seller Accounting Policies. The
term "CURRENT ASSETS" shall mean the combined net account receivables, net
inventory and prepaid and other current assets of the Acquired Business, all
calculated (A) in accordance with the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Accounting
Policies and Procedures previously delivered to Buyer and in effect as of
December 31, 2000, (B) to give effect to the requirements of Emerging Issues
Task Force Issue No. 00-14 "ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN SALES INCENTIVES" and (C)
otherwise in conformity with the basis of presentation described in the
<PAGE>   18

                                                                              10

notes to the Financial Statements (clauses (A), (B) and (C), collectively, the
"SELLER ACCOUNTING POLICIES"). The term "CURRENT LIABILITIES" shall mean the sum
of (x) combined accounts payable and accrued liabilities of the Acquired
Business (other than the CMO) and (y)(1) the sum of 50% of combined accounts
payable and accrued liabilities of the CMO other than brokers' commissions and
(2) all brokers' commissions related to Clairol included in combined accounts
payable of the CMO, all calculated in accordance with the Seller Accounting
Policies. For the avoidance of doubt, current assets and current liabilities
relating to cash and cash equivalents, Taxes, deferred Tax assets and deferred
Tax liabilities, intercompany transactions, any other Excluded Assets and any
other Excluded Liabilities are not included in the Clairol Balance Sheet, the
Boclaro Working Capital Statement or the CMO Working Capital Statement shall not
be taken into account in determining Working Capital. Items for which Buyer and
its Affiliates (including the Clairol Entities and any Buyer Subsidiaries that
acquire Acquired Assets or assume Assumed Liabilities) are indemnified by Seller
pursuant to Article XI shall not be taken into account in determining Working
Capital. The parties agree that the adjustment contemplated by Section 2.02(b)
is intended to show the change in Working Capital from December 31, 2000, to the
Closing Date and that such change can only be measured if the calculation is
done in the same way, using the Seller Accounting Policies at both dates.

           (c) The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm
is limited to whether such calculations were done in accordance with Section
2.02(b), including whether the calculations were in compliance with Seller
Accounting Policies and whether there were mathematical errors in the Statement,
and the Accounting Firm is not to make any other determination, including any
determination as to whether the Seller Accounting Policies are in accordance
with GAAP or whether GAAP was followed for the Statement or as to whether the
W.C. Amount is correct. Any items on or omissions from the Clairol Balance
Sheet, the Boclaro Working Capital Statement or the CMO Working Capital
Statement that are based upon errors of fact or mathematical errors or that are
not in accordance with the Seller Accounting Policies shall be carried forward
for purposes of calculating Closing Working Capital, as applicable.

           (d)  Until the later to occur of (i) the date on which the Statement
shall become final and binding on the
<PAGE>   19

                                                                              11

parties pursuant to Section 2.02(a)(ii) and (ii) the date on which the Assumed
Liabilities Statement (as defined in the CMO Transitional Services Agreement)
shall become final and binding on the parties pursuant to Section 5.03 of the
CMO Transitional Services Agreement, Buyer agrees that following the Closing it
shall not take any actions with respect to the accounting books and records of
Clairol on which the Statement is to be based that are not consistent with the
Acquired Business' past practices except to the extent that such changes are, in
the written opinion of outside counsel, necessary to comply with Applicable Law.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no changes shall be made
during such period in any reserve or other account existing as of December 31,
2000, except as a result of events occurring after December 31, 2000 and, in
such event, only in a manner consistent with past practices.

           (e) Until the later to occur of (i) the date on which the Statement
shall become final and binding on the parties pursuant to Section 2.02(a)(ii)
and (ii) the date on which the Assumed Liabilities Statement (as defined in the
CMO Transitional Services Agreement) shall become final and binding on the
parties pursuant to Section 5.03 of the CMO Transitional Services Agreement,
Buyer agrees that following the Closing it shall, and shall cause the Acquired
Business (including the Clairol Entities and any Buyer Subsidiaries that acquire
Acquired Assets or assume Assumed Liabilities) to, afford to Seller and any
accountants, counsel or financial advisors retained by Seller in connection with
any adjustment to the Purchase Price contemplated by this Section 2.02 and the
calculation of each of the BMS Division's Allocable Portion of the CMO Accounts
Payable and Accrued Liabilities reasonable access upon reasonable notice during
normal business hours to the properties, books, contracts, personnel and records
of the Acquired Business (including the Clairol Entities and any Buyer
Subsidiaries that acquire Acquired Assets or assume Assumed Liabilities) and
Buyer's and its accountant's work papers relating to the Statement and the
Assumed Liabilities Statement relevant to the adjustment contemplated by this
Section 2.02 and the calculation of each of the BMS Division's Allocable Portion
of the CMO Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities and shall provide Seller
upon Seller's reasonable request and at Seller's expense, with copies of any
such books, contracts and records, including Buyer's and its accountants, work
papers relating to the Statement.

                              CONDITIONS TO CLOSING

          SECTION 3.01. BUYER'S OBLIGATION. The obligation of Buyer to purchase
and pay for the Clairol Shares, the International Shares and the Acquired Assets
and to assume the Assumed Liabilities is subject to the satisfaction (or written
waiver by Buyer) as of the Closing of the following conditions:

          (a) (i) The representations and warranties of Seller made in this
     Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of
     the date hereof, except to the extent such representations and warranties
     expressly relate to an earlier date (in which case such representations and
     warranties shall be true and correct in all material respects, on and as of
     such earlier date) and (ii) the representations and warranties of Seller
     made in Sections 4.01, 4.02, 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 4.08, 4.10, 4.11
     and 4.14 shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the date
     hereof and as of the time of the Closing as though made as of such time,
     except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate
     to an earlier date (in which case such representations and warranties shall
     be true and correct in all material respects, on and as of such earlier
     date), in each case in clauses (i) and (ii) except for breaches as to
     matters that, individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably
     likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Seller shall have performed or
     complied in all material respects with all obligations and covenants
     required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by Seller by
     the time of the Closing; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that for purposes of this
     condition each of the covenants in Section 5.02 with respect to the conduct
     by Seller of the Acquired Business from the date hereof to the Closing that
     are qualified by references to the phrase "consistent with past practice"
     shall be read as if such phrase were deleted from such covenants. Seller
     shall have delivered to Buyer a certificate dated the Closing Date and
     signed by an authorized officer of Seller confirming the foregoing.

           (b) No statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, temporary
     restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order
     enacted, entered,
<PAGE>   21

                                                                              13

     promulgated, enforced or issued by any Federal, state, local or foreign
     government or any court of competent jurisdiction, administrative agency or
     commission or other governmental authority or instrumentality, domestic or
     foreign (a "GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY"), or other legal restraint or prohibition
     shall be in effect preventing (i) the purchase and sale of the Clairol
     Shares or (ii) prior to the Twelve Month Anniversary, the purchase or sale
     of any portion of the International Shares or any portion of the Acquired
     Assets or the assumption of any portion of the Assumed Liabilities, to the
     extent the exclusion of such portion of the International Shares, Acquired
     Assets or Assumed Liabilities would be reasonably likely to have a Material
     Adverse Effect.

          (c) (i) The waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
     Improvements Act of 1976 (the "HSR ACT"), the Mexican Federal Economic
     Competition Law (the "MEXICAN MERGER REGULATION") and Section 123 of the
     Competition Act (Canada) (the "CANADA COMPETITION ACT"), if applicable to
     the Transaction, shall have expired or been terminated and in Canada, Buyer
     shall have been advised in writing, in a form and upon terms reasonably
     satisfactory to Buyer, that the Commissioner of Competition does not oppose
     the Transaction and will not make an application under Section 92 or any
     other section of the Competition Act in relation to the Transaction. Any
     consents, authorizations, orders, approvals, declarations and filings under
     the HSR Act, the Mexican Merger Regulation, the Canada Competition Act or
     any other applicable antitrust law, the absence of which would prohibit the
     consummation of (i) the purchase and sale of the Clairol Shares or (ii) the
     purchase and sale of any portion of the International Shares or any portion
     of the Acquired Assets, or the assumption of any portion of the Assumed
     Liabilities, to the extent the exclusion of such portion of the
     International Shares, Acquired Assets or Assumed Liabilities would be
     reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, shall have been made
     or obtained.

          (ii) The Office of Fair Trading shall have indicated, in terms and a
     form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, that it is not the intention of the
     Secretary of the State for Trade and Industry to refer the proposed
     acquisition of the Clairol Shares, the International Shares and the
     Acquired Assets and the assumption of the
<PAGE>   22

                                                                              14

     Assumed Liabilities, or any matter arising therefrom, to the Competition
     Commission; and/or if the Secretary of the State for Trade and Industry
     makes a reference to the Competition Commission, either:

              (A) the Competition Commission has concluded, in terms and a form
          reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, that neither the acquisition of the
          Clairol Shares, the International Shares and the Acquired Assets and
          the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, nor any matter arising
          therefrom, may be expected to operate against the public interest;
          and/or

               (B) the Secretary of the State for Trade and Industry allowing
          the acquisition of the Clairol Shares, the International Shares and
          the Acquired Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities to
          proceed on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer.

          Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary herein, on and after the
     Twelve Month Anniversary of the date of this Agreement, the conditions set
     forth in Section 3.01(b)(ii) and Section 3.01(c) shall cease to be
     conditions to Buyer's obligation to purchase and pay for the Clairol
     Shares, the International Shares and the Acquired Assets and to assume the
     Assumed Liabilities.

          (d) Seller shall have executed and delivered, or shall have caused its
     Affiliates named as parties to any Transaction Document other than this
     Agreement (the "OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS") to execute and deliver, the
     Other Transaction Documents.

          SECTION 3.02. SELLER'S OBLIGATION. The obligation of Seller to sell
and deliver the Clairol Shares, the International Shares, the Acquired Assets
and the Assumed Liabilities to Buyer is subject to the satisfaction (or written
waiver by Seller) as of the Closing of the following conditions:

           (a) The representations and warranties of Buyer made in this
     Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects, as of the
     date hereof and as of the time of the Closing as though made as of such
     time, except to the extent such representations and warranties
<PAGE>   23

                                                                              15

     expressly relate to an earlier date (in which case such representations and
     warranties shall be true and correct in all material respects, on and as of
     such earlier date), in each case except for breaches as to matters that,
     individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have a
     material adverse effect on the ability of Buyer to consummate the
     transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer shall have performed or complied in
     all material respects with all obligations and covenants required by this
     Agreement to be performed or complied with by Buyer by the time of the
     Closing. Buyer shall have delivered to Seller a certificate dated the
     Closing Date and signed by an authorized officer of Buyer confirming the
     foregoing.

          (b) No statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, temporary
     restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order
     enacted, entered, promulgated, enforced or issued by any Governmental
     Entity or other legal restraint or prohibition shall be in effect
     preventing (i) the purchase and sale of the Clairol Shares or (ii) the
     purchase and sale of any portion of the International Shares material,
     individually or in the aggregate, to the Acquired Business or any portion
     of the Acquired Assets material, individually or in the aggregate, to the
     Acquired Business or the assumption of any portion of the Assumed
     Liabilities material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Acquired
     Business.

          (c) The waiting period under the HSR Act, the Mexican Merger
     Regulation and the Canada Competition Act and the merger control act in the
     United Kingdom or any other antitrust law, if applicable to the
     Transaction, shall have expired or been terminated. Any consents,
     authorizations, orders, approvals, declarations and filings under the HSR
     Act, the Mexican Merger Regulation, the Canada Competition Act or any other
     applicable antitrust law, the absence of which would prohibit the
     consummation of (i) the purchase of the Clairol Shares or (ii) the purchase
     and sale of any portion of the International Shares material, individually
     or in the aggregate, to the Acquired Business or any portion of the
     Acquired Assets material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Acquired
     Business or the assumption of any portion of the Assumed Liabilities
     material,
<PAGE>   24

                                                                              16

     individually or in the aggregate, to the Acquired Business, shall have been
     made or obtained.

           (d) Buyer shall have executed and delivered, or shall have caused its
     Affiliates named as parties to any Other Transaction Document to execute
     and deliver, the Other Transaction Documents.

           SECTION 3.03. FRUSTRATION OF CLOSING CONDITIONS. Neither Buyer nor
Seller may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Section 3.01 or
3.02, respectively, to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such party's
failure to act in good faith or to use its best efforts to cause the Closing to
occur, as required by Section 8.04.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

          Except as set forth in the Seller Disclosure Schedule attached hereto
(the "SELLER DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE"), Seller hereby represents and warrants to
Buyer with respect to Sections 4.01, 4.02, 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 4.08,
4.09, 4.10, 4.11 and 4.14, as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date,
except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an
earlier date (in which case such representations and warranties shall be true
and correct in all material respects, on and as of such earlier date) and with
respect to all other representations and warranties, as of the date hereof,
except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an
earlier date (in which case such representations and warranties shall be true
and correct in all material respects, on and as of such earlier date), as
follows:

           SECTION 4.01. AUTHORITY. Seller is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware

           SECTION 4.14. BENEFIT PLANS. The representations made herein in
Sections 4.14(a)-(h) below relate solely to plans and arrangements maintained by
Seller, the Seller Entities or the Clairol Entities for Employees (as defined in

           (a) Section 4.14(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule contains a list

Subsidiaries for the benefit of any officers or employees of the Company or the
U.S. Clairol Subsidiaries. Seller has made available to Buyer true, complete and

Plan has been administered in all material respects in accordance with its
terms; (ii) the Company or the U.S. Clairol Subsidiaries and all the Benefit
Plans are in compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions

by any Governmental Entity or other claims (except claims for benefits payable
in the normal operation of the Benefit Plans) pending or threatened against or
involving any Benefit Plan or asserting any rights to benefits under any Benefit
Plan.

           (c) Except for matters that would not be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect, (i) all contributions to, and payments from, the
Benefit Plans that have been required to be made in accordance with the Benefit
Plans and, when applicable, Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code,
have been timely made, (ii) there has been no application for or waiver of the
minimum funding standards imposed by Section 412 of the Code with respect to any
Pension Plan and (iii) no Pension Plan has an "ACCUMULATED FUNDING DEFICIENCY"
within the meaning of Section 412(a) of the Code as of the most recent plan
year.

           (d) All Pension Plans that are intended to qualify under Section
401(c) of the Code have been the subject of determination letters from the
Internal Revenue Service to the effect that such Pension Plans are qualified and
exempt from Federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively,
of the Code, and no such determination letter has been revoked nor, to the
knowledge of Seller, has revocation been threatened, nor has any such Pension
Plan been amended since the date of its most recent determination letter or
application therefor in any respect that is reasonably expected to adversely
affect its qualification or materially increase its cost.

           (e) Except for matters that would not be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect, (i) to Seller's knowledge, no "PROHIBITED TRANSACTION"
(as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA) has occurred
that involves the assets of any Benefit Plan and that is reasonably expected to
subject the Company or the U.S. Clairol Subsidiaries or any of its employees, or
a trustee, administrator or other fiduciary of any trusts created under any
Benefit Plan to a material tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by
Section 4975 of ERISA or the sanctions imposed under Title I of ERISA; (ii) none
of the Pension Plans has been terminated nor have there been any "REPORTABLE
EVENTS" (as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA and the regulations thereunder)
with respect thereto that are required to be reported to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation by law or regulation; and (iii) to the knowledge of Seller,
neither Seller nor any trustee, administrator or other fiduciary of any Benefit
Plan nor any agent of any of the

foregoing has engaged in any transaction or acted or failed to act in a manner
that is reasonably expected to subject the Company or the U.S. Clairol
Subsidiaries to any material liability for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA
or any other applicable law.

           (f) Except for amounts that would not be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect, with respect to any Pension Plan subject to Title IV of
ERISA (including for the purposes of this Section 4.14(f) any Pension Plan
maintained or contributed to by Seller or any other person required to be
treated as a single employer with Seller under Section 414 of the Code), Seller
has not incurred any material liability to such Pension Plan or to the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation, other than for the payment of contributions or
premiums. Seller has delivered or made available to Buyer the most recent
actuarial report or valuation with respect to each Pension Plan that is a
"DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN" (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA.

           (g) At no time within the five years preceding the Closing Date has
Seller or the Company or the U.S. Clairol Subsidiaries been required to
contribute to any "MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA) for the benefit of any employees of the Company or the U.S. Clairol
Subsidiaries or incurred any withdrawal liability, within the meaning of Section
4201 of ERISA, with respect to any multiemployer plan for the benefit of
employees of the Company or the U.S. Clairol Subsidiaries, which liability has
not been fully paid as of the date hereof, or announced an intention to
withdraw, but not yet completed such withdrawal, from any such multiemployer
plan.

           (h) Except for matters that would not be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect, each Benefit Plan that is a group health plan, as such
term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code, complies in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the Code.

           (i) Except for matters that would not be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect or as disclosed in writing to Buyer, to the knowledge of
Seller, all plans and arrangements maintained outside of the United States for
the benefit of Employees are in material compliance with all applicable laws of
the relevant jurisdiction in which such plans or arrangements are maintained.
Section 4.14(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule contains a list of the
material

                                                                              37

employee benefit plans maintained by Seller, the Seller Entities or the Clairol
Entities for Employees primarily based in countries and territories other than

           SECTION 4.15. ABSENCE OF CHANGES OR EVENTS. (a) As of the date of
this Agreement, since December 31, 2000, there has not been any material adverse
change in the business, financial condition or results of operations of the
Acquired Business other than changes relating to United States or foreign
economies in general or the Acquired Business's industries in general and not
specifically relating to the Acquired Business. Buyer acknowledges that there
has been and will continue to be a disruption to the Acquired Business as a
result of the possibility of a sale by Seller of the Acquired Business to
Buyer(and there may be further disruption to the Acquired Business as a result
of the execution and public announcement of this Agreement and the Other
Transaction Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby) (any such disruption, a "BUSINESS DISRUPTION"), and Buyer
agrees that any such Business Disruption does not and shall not constitute a
breach of this Section 4.15.

           (b) As of the date of this Agreement, except as contemplated by this
Agreement and the Other Transaction Documents (including the Seller Disclosure
Schedule), including actions taken in furtherance of the separation of the
Acquired Business from Seller and its Affiliates, since December 31, 2000,
Seller has caused the Acquired Business to be conducted in the ordinary course
and none of Seller, the Seller Entities or the Clairol Entities has taken any
action that, if taken after the date of this Agreement, would constitute a
breach of any of the covenants set forth in Section 5.02.

           SECTION 4.16. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS. As of the date of this
Agreement:

           (a) Except as previously disclosed by Seller to Buyer in writing,
Seller, the Seller Entities and the Clairol Entities are in compliance with all
applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, orders and regulations of any
Governmental Entity ("APPLICABLE LAWS") (in the case of Seller and the Seller
Entities, solely to the extent related to the Acquired Business conducted by
Seller and the Seller Entities), including those relating to occupational health
and safety, except for instances of noncompliance that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have a

                                                                              38

Material Adverse Effect. None of Seller, the Seller Entities or the Clairol
Entities has received any written communication during the two years prior to
the date hereof from a Governmental Entity that alleges that Seller, any of the
Seller Entities or any of the Clairol Entities is in violation of any Applicable
Laws (in the case of Seller or the Seller Entities, solely to the extent related
to the Acquired Business conducted by Seller and the Seller Entities) except for
any such violations that, individually or in the aggregate, would not be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. This Section 4.16(a) does
not relate to matters with respect to Taxes, which are the subject of Section
4.08, to employee benefit or ERISA matters which are the subject of Section 4.14
or to environmental matters, which are the subject of Section 4.16(b).

           (b) Seller has provided Buyer with certain environmental reports

the Seller Entities (in the case of Seller and the Seller Entities, solely to
the extent such reports relate to the Acquired Business conducted by Seller and
the Seller Entities) which are identified in Section 4.16(b) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule (the "ENVIRONMENTAL REPORTS"). Except as set forth in the
Environmental Reports, and except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, (i) none of
Seller, the Seller Entities or the Clairol Entities has received any written
communication during the two years prior to the date hereof from a Governmental
Entity that alleges that any of Seller, the Seller Entities or the Clairol

same may be amended from time to time, the "LION AGREEMENT"), by and between the
Seller and Lion Corporation ("LION"), which grants to Lion, among other things,
the exclusive right to Vitalis and other products (the "COVERED PRODUCTS") in
Japan. Buyer agrees not to, and agrees to cause any purchaser or transferee of
the Acquired Business or rights with respect to the Covered Products to agree
not to, directly or indirectly, manufacture, market or sell Covered Products in
Japan. Buyer shall have no liability to Seller pursuant to this Section 7.07 if,
through no fault or knowledge of Buyer, a third party unaffiliated with Buyer
sells any Covered Products in the Japanese market; PROVIDED that if Buyer learns
of such diversion of Covered Products into the Japanese market by a third party,
Buyer shall use its best efforts to cease selling Covered Products to such third
party.

           SECTION 7.08. CERTAIN ACTIONS. Buyer agrees not to take any of the
actions set forth in Schedule I.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                MUTUAL COVENANTS

          Each of Seller and Buyer covenants and agrees as follows:

           SECTION 8.01. CONSENTS. Buyer acknowledges that consents and waivers
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Other
Transaction Documents may be required from parties to contracts that are
Acquired Assets or Assumed Liabilities, or contracts to which a Clairol Entity
is a party, including the Contracts listed in the Seller Disclosure Schedule
(collectively, the "TRANSFERRED CONTRACTS") or with respect to environmental
permits or other assets and that such consents and waivers have not been
<PAGE>   59

                                                                              51

obtained. Buyer agrees that Seller shall not have any liability whatsoever to
Buyer arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consents or
waivers that may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or because of the termination of any Transferred Contract as a
result thereof. Buyer further agrees that no representation, warranty or
covenant of Seller contained herein shall be breached or deemed breached, and no
condition shall be deemed not satisfied, as a result of (a) the failure to
obtain any such consent or waiver, (b) any such termination or (c) any lawsuit,
action, proceeding or investigation commenced or threatened by or on behalf of
any person arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any such consent
or any such termination. Prior to the Closing, Seller and Buyer will use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all such consents and waivers;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such efforts shall not include any requirement of Seller
or any of its Affiliates to expend money, commence, defend or participate in any
litigation, incur any obligation in favor of, or offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise) to, any third party, and all costs and
expenses related to seeking and obtaining such consents and waivers shall be for
Buyer's account.

           SECTION 8.02. COOPERATION. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with each
other, and shall cause their officers, employees, agents, auditors and
representatives to cooperate with each other, for a period of 60 days after the
Closing to ensure the orderly transition of the Acquired Business from Seller to
Buyer and to minimize any disruption to the respective businesses of Seller,
Buyer and the Acquired Business, that might result from the transactions
contemplated hereby. After the Closing, upon reasonable written notice, Buyer
and Seller shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other and their
employees, counsel, auditors and representatives access, during normal business
hours, to such information and assistance relating to the Acquired Business as
is reasonably necessary for financial reporting and accounting matters, the
preparation and filing of any Tax returns, reports or forms or the defense of
any Tax claim or assessment. The obligation to cooperate pursuant to the
preceding sentence insofar as it concerns Taxes shall terminate at the time the
relevant applicable statute of limitations expires (giving effect to any
extension thereof). Each party shall reimburse the other for reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses incurred in assisting the other pursuant to this
Section 8.02. Neither party shall be
<PAGE>   60

                                                                              52

interfere with the conduct of its business or unreasonably disrupt its normal
operations (or, in the case of Buyer, the Acquired Business).

           SECTION 8.03. PUBLICITY. Seller and Buyer agree that, from the date
hereof through the Closing Date, no public release or announcement concerning
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by either party without the
prior consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), except as such release or announcement may be required by law or the
rules or regulations of any United States or foreign securities exchange, in
which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall allow
the other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance.

           SECTION 8.04. BEST EFFORTS. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement (including the provisions set forth in Sections 8.01 and
8.05), each party shall use its best efforts to cause the Closing to occur.
Without limiting the foregoing or the provisions set forth in Section 8.05 and
without limiting the requirements for Closing set forth in Section 2.01(a),
Buyer and Seller shall use their respective best efforts to cause the Closing to
occur on or prior to the Six Month Anniversary or as soon as practicable
thereafter. Except as expressly provided in Section 8.05(c), each of Seller and
Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any of their respective Affiliates to,
take any action that would, or that could reasonably be expected to, result in
any of the conditions to the purchase and sale of the Clairol Shares, the
International Shares and the Acquired Assets and the assignment and assumption
of the Assumed Liabilities set forth in Article III not being satisfied.

           (b) Except as expressly provided in Section 8.05(c), Buyer shall use
its best efforts to have any restraint or prohibition of the type described in
clause (z) of the proviso to Section 2.01(a)(ii) terminated as promptly as
practicable.

           (c) Buyer and Seller agree that Seller's right to (i) receive
interest on the Purchase Price after the Six Month Anniversary pursuant to
Section 1.01(a), (ii) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 13.01(d) and
(iii) receive the payment specified in Section 13.03 upon a termination pursuant

<PAGE>   61

                                                                              53

alter, modify or otherwise change Buyer's obligations under this Section 8.04 to
use its best efforts to cause the Closing to occur (including its obligation to
use best efforts to cause the Closing to occur on or prior to the Six Month
Anniversary or as soon as practicable thereafter) or to cause any restraint or
prohibition of the type described in clause (z) of the proviso to Section
2.01(a)(ii) to be lifted or terminated.

           SECTION 8.05. ANTITRUST NOTIFICATION AND OTHER REGULATORY FILINGS.
(a) Each of Seller and Buyer shall as promptly as practicable, but in no event
later than five business days following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, file with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and
the United States Department of Justice (the "DOJ") the notification and report
form required for the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Buyer and Seller
shall furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance
as the other may request in connection with its preparation of any filing or
submission which is necessary under the HSR Act. Seller and Buyer shall keep
each other apprised of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries
or requests for additional information from, the FTC and the DOJ and shall
comply with any such inquiry or request as promptly as practicable, but in no
event later than five business days after receipt of such inquiry or request.
Any such notification and report form and supplemental information shall be in
substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act. Each of Seller and
Buyer shall use its best efforts to obtain any clearance required under the HSR
Act for the Transaction.

           (b) Seller and Buyer shall make any required regulatory filings, and
shall use their best efforts to obtain any required regulatory consents,
authorizations, orders, approvals and declarations outside the United States, in
each case as promptly as practicable after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, including filings under the Mexican Merger Regulation, the Canada
Competition Act and the merger control acts in the United Kingdom and Germany
and the Irish Mergers Act.

           (c) Seller and Buyer shall further use their best efforts to (i) if
and to the extent Buyer so elects, contest any Antitrust Proceeding until each
such Antitrust Proceeding is either resolved pursuant to a final nonappealable
court order or Buyer has determined not to further contest such Antitrust
Proceeding and (ii) once all such Antitrust
<PAGE>   62

                                                                              54

Proceedings are so resolved or abandoned by Buyer, take such actions as may be
necessary to resolve any objections as may be asserted by any Governmental
Entity to obtain all necessary clearances and approvals under the U.S. Antitrust
Laws. Subject to Buyer's obligations pursuant to Section 8.05(a) to keep Seller
apprised of the status of the regulatory process, Buyer shall control the
regulatory process to obtain all such clearances and consents under the U.S.
Antitrust Laws (including all Antitrust Proceedings), subject to Seller's right
to participate therein. Seller shall not have independent substantive contacts
with any Governmental Entities administering the U.S. Antitrust Laws with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (unless Seller is otherwise
advised by its counsel that it is advisable for Seller to do so).

           (d) Buyer and Seller agree that Seller's right to (i) receive
interest on the Purchase Price after the Six Month Anniversary pursuant to
Section 1.01(a), (ii) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 13.01(d) and
(iii) receive the payment specified in Section 13.03 upon a termination pursuant
to Section 13.01(d), do not, in any manner, reduce, lessen, alter, modify, or
otherwise change Buyer's obligations under this Section 8.05 to use its best
efforts to obtain any clearance required under the HSR Act for the Transaction
and any other required regulatory consents, authorizations, orders, approvals
and declarations outside the United States.

           SECTION 8.06. RECORDS. As soon as practicable on or after the Closing
Date, Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer all Records, if
any, in the possession of Seller and its Affiliates relating to the Acquired

      (i) Buyer recognizes that certain Records may contain incidental

subsidiaries or divisions of Seller other than the Acquired Business and that
Seller may retain such Records and shall provide copies of the relevant portions
thereof to Buyer;

      (ii) Seller may retain all Records prepared in connection with the
Transaction, including bids received from other parties and analyses relating to

acknowledges that, except to the extent provided in the Transitional Services
Agreements, all Support Services will be terminated as of the Closing Date.

      SECTION 8.08. COLLECTION OF RECEIVABLES; FORWARDING OF PAYMENTS. From and
after the Closing, Buyer and each of the Buyer Subsidiaries and Clairol
Entities, as applicable, shall have the right and authority to collect for its
own account all Receivables and other related items that are included in the
Acquired Assets and to endorse with the name of Seller or an Affiliate of
Seller, as applicable, any checks or drafts received with respect to any
Receivables or such other related items. Seller shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, promptly deliver to Buyer, the Buyer Subsidiaries and the Clairol
Entities, as applicable, any cash or other property received directly or
indirectly by it with respect to the Receivables and such other related items.

or indirectly by it with respect to the Excluded Receivables or any other
Excluded Assets.

      SECTION 8.09 ADVISORY COMMITTEES. Seller and Buyer shall establish four
advisory committees (the "ADVISORY COMMITTEES"), which shall each act as a forum
in which issues and disputes arising under the International Sales and
Distribution Transitional Services Agreement, the GBS Transitional Services
Agreement, the CMO Transitional Services Agreement and the IM Transitional
Services Agreement, respectively, can be evaluated and discussed. Each Advisory
Committee will consist of four members, with Buyer eligible to designate two

to comply with Applicable Laws after the Closing ("TRANSITIONAL RELABELING
SERVICES"). Buyer agrees that, not less than thirty days prior to the Closing
Date, it will provide written notice to Seller if Buyer or its Affiliates will
require Seller or its Affiliates to perform Transitional Relabeling Services.
Any notice provided pursuant to this Section 8.10 shall describe the
Transitional Relabeling Services, including the nature of such services and the
countries in which they will be necessary. Seller and Buyer further agree that,
to the extent any such notice is provided, they will agree on a fee for such
services based on the fully burdened costs of the party responsible for
providing the services, and the Schedules to the International Sales and
Distribution Transitional Services Agreement shall be appropriately modified to
reflect such services and the related fees for such services.

Buyer, shall, or shall cause the Buyer Subsidiaries and the Clairol Entities to,
assume and be responsible for all employment and employee benefit-related
matters, obligations and liabilities that are payable on or after the Closing

employees on leave of absence or vacation, employees on short-term or long-term

responsibilities, liabilities and obligations with respect to the Employees and
their beneficiaries, including any claims incurred at any time, and (ii) Seller

assume the collective bargaining agreement between Clairol, Inc. and Local 300S,

the Closing Date.

           (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, as of
the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause, the Buyer Subsidiaries and the
Clairol Entities to, continue the employment of Employees based in locations
outside the United States as required by the Acquired Rights Directive or any
similar law in the relevant jurisdiction, and shall grant for a period of not
less than that provided for by local country law, substantially the same terms
and conditions of employment that apply to such Employees immediately prior to
the Closing Date. The term "ACQUIRED RIGHTS DIRECTIVE" shall mean the "European
Council Directive of February 14, 1977 on the Approximation of the Laws of the
Member States relating to the Safeguarding of Employee's Rights in the Event of
Transfers of Undertakings, Business or Parts of Businesses"

addition, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, as of the
Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Buyer Subsidiaries and the Clairol
Entities to, offer and continue the employment of the Employees on the same
terms and conditions as in effect before the Closing Date, where necessary to
avoid the imposition of severance or similar obligations on Seller or its
Affiliates or where otherwise required by law.

           (c) For not less than 18 months following the Closing Date (the
"CONTINUATION PERIOD"), Buyer shall maintain, or, where applicable, shall cause
the Buyer Subsidiaries and the Clairol Entities to maintain (to the extent
permitted by law), compensation arrangements, employee benefit plans, and
perquisites with respect to Employees that are comparable in the aggregate to
those provided to such Employees by Seller and its Affiliates immediately prior
to the Closing Date. In the alternative, during the Continuation Period, Buyer
may replace or, where applicable, cause the Buyer Subsidiaries and the Clairol
Entities to replace (to the extent permitted by law), Seller's compensation
arrangements, employee benefit plans and perquisites with compensation
arrangements, employee benefit plans and perquisites that are comparable in the
aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer and the
Buyer Subsidiaries, PROVIDED that Employees shall either be treated entirely
under the first sentence or entirely under the second sentence of this Section
9.03(c). With respect to Buyer's stock-based plans, all Employees in Seller's
grades D-8 and above, and at least 50% of the Employees in Seller's grades D-6
and D-7, shall receive stock awards from Buyer in accordance with this Section
9.03 immediately after the Closing, and Employees' stock awards shall provide
for full vesting upon termination of employment in circumstances that entitle
such Employees to severance benefits under Section 9.08.

           (d) Buyer shall cause Employees' service with Seller and its
Affiliates before the Closing Date to be credited for all purposes for which
such service was recognized by Seller and its Affiliates with respect to all
employee benefit plans and arrangements and employment-related entitlements
provided, maintained or contributed to by Buyer, the Buyer Subsidiaries and the
Clairol Entities for Employees on or after the Closing Date, except as
specifically provided otherwise in this Article IX.

           (e) Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the

meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the "BUYER'S 401(k) PLAN") and is
intended to be qualified pursuant to Section 401(a) of the Code. Buyer shall
cause Buyer's 401(k) Plan to accept direct rollover contributions (within the
meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder) of Employee account balances which are made in the form of cash
and/or outstanding Employee loan balances from the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company
Savings and Investment Program (the "SELLER'S 401(k) PLAN"). Employees shall
have a fully vested interest in their accounts under the Seller's 401(k) Plan,
and in any accounts transferred to the Buyer's 401(k) Plan. Neither Buyer, the
Buyer Subsidiaries, Buyer's 401(k) Plan nor any of their Affiliates shall have
or assume any liability in connection with Seller's 401(k) Plan (except with
respect to accounts that are transferred as described above).

           SECTION 9.06. NON-QUALIFIED PLANS. (a) Effective as of the Closing

benefit and defined contribution plans that provide benefits to Employees who
are participating in Seller's Benefit Equalization Plans and Key International

Employees who are participating before the Closing Date in the Benefits
Equalization Plan of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and its Subsidiary or
Affiliated Corporations Participating in the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company
Savings and Investment Program ("SELLER'S BEP-SIP") with an account balance
under Buyer's BEP-SIP equal to the Employees' account balance under Seller's
BEP-SIP as of the Closing Date. Buyer shall, and shall cause the Buyer
Subsidiaries and the Clairol Entities to, assume and be responsible for paying
all benefits accrued by Employees under Seller's BEP-SIP before the Closing
Date.

           (c) Seller shall retain responsibility for all benefits accrued
before the Closing Date by Employees under (i) the Benefits Equalization Plan of
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and its Subsidiary or Affiliated Corporations
Participating in the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Retirement Income Plan or the
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Puerto Rico, Inc. Retirement Income Plan ("SELLER'S
BEP-RIP") and (ii) Seller's Key International Pension Plan ("SELLER'S KIP").
Neither Buyer, the Buyer Subsidiaries, the Clairol Entities nor any plan of
Buyer, the Buyer Subsidiaries, or the Clairol Entities shall have or assume any
liability with respect to Seller's BEP-RIP or Seller's KIP.

disability, long term disability, long term care, flexible benefit, adoption
assistance and other welfare benefit plans and programs, as applicable, in
accordance with Section 9.03. All waiting periods and pre-existing condition

their eligible dependents who were participating in the welfare benefits plans
and programs of Seller and its Affiliates
<PAGE>   70

                                                                              62

("SELLER WELFARE BENEFIT PLANS") before the Closing Date. Buyer shall cause the
Buyer Welfare Benefit Plans to recognize any out-of-pocket medical and dental
expenses incurred by each of the Employees and their eligible dependents prior

occurs for purposes of determining deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums under
the Buyer Welfare Benefit Plans.

           (b) Seller shall retain responsibility for (i) all claims incurred by
Employees under Seller's health and dental plans before the Closing Date and
(ii) all stock options and restricted stock granted to Employees under Seller's
equity plans before the Closing Date, and Buyer shall not be responsible for
such health and dental claims, stock options and restricted stock. In addition,
Buyer shall not be responsible for any dependent life insurance and other
insured benefit claims that are incurred by Employees before the Closing Date,
to the extent that such claims are paid by the insurance carrier to the
Employees according to the terms of the applicable insurance contracts
maintained by Seller.

           (c) Buyer agrees to provide or cause to be provided under the Buyer
Welfare Benefit Plans to each Employee who retires on or after the Closing Date
and during the Continuation Period, and their dependents, health care benefits
and coverage that are comparable in the aggregate to those set forth in the
Comprehensive Medical Plan Summary Plan Description for Retirees of
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or such other retiree benefit plan or arrangement
of Seller or its Affiliates that is applicable to the Employee immediately
before the Closing Date (or that would have been applicable had the Employee
been eligible to retire immediately before the Closing Date), in accordance with
Section 9.03. If Employees are eligible to receive health care benefits under
Seller's retiree plans on or after the Closing Date, Buyer agrees that Seller's
retiree plans shall be secondary to the Buyer Welfare Benefit Plans (both active
and retiree plans).

           (d) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause the
Buyer Subsidiaries and the Clairol Entities to, have in effect a health care and
dependent care reimbursement account plan (the "BUYER REIMBURSEMENT PLAN"), in
accordance with Section 9.03. Buyer's Reimbursement Plan shall give full effect
to, and continues in effect, salary reduction elections made under the health
care and dependent care reimbursement account plans of Seller and its Affiliates
as in effect on the Closing Date (the "Seller Reimbursement Plan"). The Seller
Reimbursement Plan shall transfer to the

                                                                              63

Buyer Reimbursement Plan an amount equal to the aggregate account balances of
Employees as of the Closing Date under the Seller Reimbursement Plan. Buyer
shall reimburse Seller on a dollar-for-dollar basis for forfeitures of the
Employee accounts under the Buyer Reimbursement Plan that relate to the calendar
year in which the Closing Date occurs.

           (e) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause the
Buyer Subsidiaries and the Clairol Entities to, assume all responsibilities and
obligations for continuation coverage under Sections 601 ET SEQ. of ERISA (COBRA

the Employees and their beneficiaries.

           SECTION 9.08. SEVERANCE. Buyer shall, or shall cause the Buyer
Subsidiaries and the Clairol Entities to, adopt and maintain, effective as of
the Closing Date, one or more severance policies which shall be identical in all
material respects (including the Rule of 70 provisions, as described in Seller's
written communications to Employees) to the terms of the severance policies of
Seller and its Affiliates applicable to Employees as in effect on the Closing
Date (the "SELLER SEVERANCE POLICIES") and which shall be enhanced as described
in Exhibit N (the "ENHANCED SEVERANCE PROGRAM"). Buyer shall cause the Enhanced
Severance Program to be maintained for Employees whose employment terminates on
or after the Closing Date and during the Continuation Period. Buyer and the
Buyer Subsidiaries shall assume and be responsible for paying any severance
obligations (including termination indemnities, notice liabilities and statutory
severance obligations) that are payable as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or that are otherwise payable with respect to
Employees on or after the Closing Date.

           SECTION 9.09. VACATION BENEFITS. As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall,
or shall cause the Buyer Subsidiaries and the Clairol Entities to, recognize all
of the Employees' accrued and unused vacation benefits consistent with the terms
of the vacation policies of Seller and its Affiliates applicable to Employees as
in effect on the Closing Date.

           SECTION 9.10. RELOCATION BENEFITS. As of the Closing Date, Buyer
shall, or shall cause the Buyer Subsidiaries and the Clairol Entities to,
provide each eligible Employee with relocation benefits that are comparable
<PAGE>   72

                                                                              64

in the aggregate to the relocation policies of Seller and its Affiliates that
are applicable to such Employees on the Closing Date. Buyer shall, or shall
cause the Buyer Subsidiaries and the Clairol Entities to, perform or cause to be
performed all obligations of Seller and its Affiliates with respect to
Employees' existing relocation arrangements, and Buyer shall, or shall cause the
Buyer Subsidiaries and the Clairol Entities to, have all rights and obligations
of Seller and its Affiliates under such relocation arrangements with respect to
Employees.

           SECTION 9.11. EXPATRIATES. As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or
shall cause the Buyer Subsidiaries and the Clairol Entities to, assume all
obligations and responsibilities with respect to each Employee who is or was
temporarily assigned to work at a location outside such Employee's home country
("EXPATRIATES") as of the Closing Date as disclosed to Buyer. Such obligations
and responsibilities shall include, without limitation, compensation increments,
housing expenses, travel expenses, relocation expenses and all other applicable
benefits, all of which shall be provided by Buyer according to the terms of the
Employee's agreement with Seller and its Affiliates as in effect before the
Closing Date. Buyer and Seller shall take all actions necessary so that Buyer,
the Buyer Subsidiaries and the Clairol Entities shall have all rights and
obligations of Seller and its Affiliates with respect to Expatriates, including
rights and obligations under tax equalization agreements with the Expatriates.

           SECTION 9.12. OTHER AGREEMENTS AND BENEFITS. Without limiting the
foregoing, as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Buyer
Subsidiaries and the Clairol Entities to, assume all liabilities, and perform or
cause to be performed all obligations, of Seller or its Affiliates under the

as of the Closing Date as disclosed to Buyer: (i) employment and supplemental
benefit agreements with respect to Employees based in countries outside the
United States, (ii) tuition assistance programs and automobile policies, and
(iii) statutory benefits applicable to Employees and their beneficiaries.

           SECTION 9.13. ANNUAL BONUSES. As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or

                                                                              65

plans of Seller and its Affiliates.

           SECTION 9.14. RETENTION BONUS ARRANGEMENTS. (a) To the extent so
requested by Seller, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Buyer Subsidiaries and the
Clairol Entities to, administer and make any and all retention bonus payments
required to be made to Employees pursuant to the retention bonus arrangements of
Seller and its Affiliates that are applicable to the Employees, as set forth in
the retention bonus announcements to Employees dated October 2000 from Charles
G. Tharp. Seller shall retain the economic obligation with respect to such
retention bonus payments to Employees and shall reimburse Buyer, the Buyer
Subsidiaries or the Clairol Entities, as applicable, for the net cost of such
retention bonus payments made by Buyer, the Buyer Subsidiaries or the Clairol
Entities to Employees.

           (b) In addition to the foregoing, as of the Closing Date, Buyer
shall, and shall cause the Buyer Subsidiaries and the Clairol Entities to,
provide to Employees the additional retention bonuses described in Exhibit N.
Buyer shall be liable for all costs of the retention bonuses described in
Exhibit N.

          SECTION 10.01. FURTHER ASSURANCES. From time to time, as and when
requested by either party hereto, the other party shall execute and deliver, or
cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall
take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions (subject to the

Agreement.

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

          SECTION 11.01. TAX INDEMNIFICATION. (a) Seller shall indemnify Buyer
and its Affiliates (including the Clairol Entities) and each of their respective
officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents and representatives and
hold them harmless from (i) all liability for Taxes of the Clairol Entities and
Taxes relating to the Acquired Assets for the Pre-Closing Tax Period (including
any U.S. federal income Taxes imposed on the Company or the U.S. Clairol
Subsidiaries as a result of the Code Section 338(h)(10) election contemplated by
Section 12.04 of this Agreement), (ii) all liability for Taxes of the Clairol
Entities for any taxable period ending after the Closing Date attributable to
Seller's breach of its obligations under Section 12.04, and (iii) all liability
as a result of Treasury Regulation sec. 1.1502-6(a) for Taxes of Seller or any
other corporation which is or has been affiliated with Seller (other than the
Clairol Entities). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not indemnify and
hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Clairol Entities) and each
of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents, from any liability
for Taxes attributable to any action taken on or after the Closing Date by
Buyer, any of its Affiliates (including the Clairol Entities), or any transferee
of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (other than any such action expressly required
by Applicable Law or by this Agreement) (a "BUYER TAX ACT") or attributable to a
breach by Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement.

           (b) Buyer shall, and shall cause the Buyer Subsidiaries and Clairol
Entities to, indemnify Seller and its Affiliates and each of their respective
officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents and representatives and
hold them harmless from (i) all liability for Taxes of the Clairol Entities and
Taxes relating to the Acquired Assets for any taxable period ending after the
Closing Date (except to the extent such taxable period began before the Closing
Date, in which case Buyer's indemnity will cover only that portion of any such
Taxes that are not for the Pre-Closing Tax Period) and (ii) all liability for
Taxes attributable to a Buyer Tax Act or to a breach by Buyer of its obligations
under this Agreement.
<PAGE>   75

                                                                              67

           (c) In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end
on) the Closing Date (a "STRADDLE PERIOD"):

          (i) real, personal and intangible property Taxes ("PROPERTY TAXES") of
     the Clairol Entities and Property Taxes relating to the Acquired Assets
     allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the amount of
     such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
     fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle
     Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which
     is the number of days in the Straddle Period; and

         (ii) the Taxes of the Clairol Entities and Taxes relating to the
     Acquired Assets (other than Property Taxes) allocable to the Pre-Closing
     Tax Period shall be computed as if such taxable period ended as of the
     close of business on the Closing Date.

           SECTION 11.02. OTHER INDEMNIFICATION BY SELLER. (a) Except as relates
to Taxes, for which the sole indemnification is provided in Section 11.01,
Seller shall indemnify Buyer, its Affiliates (including the Clairol Entities)
and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders,
agents and representatives against and hold them harmless from any loss,
liability, claim, damage or expense (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses) suffered or incurred by any such indemnified party to the extent
arising from (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Seller
contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto, in
each case, which survives the Closing, (ii) any breach of any covenant of Seller
contained in this Agreement or any Other Transaction Document, (iii) any failure
of Seller to perform or satisfy any employee benefit obligations or liabilities
specifically retained by Seller under Article IX, (iv) all Excluded Liabilities
or (v) any breach by Buyer or any of its Affiliates of the Agreements set forth
in Section 11.02(a)(v) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (A) Seller shall not have any liability under clause (i) or clause
(ii) of this Section 11.02(a) (in the case of clause (ii), only with respect to
breaches of covenants that occur prior to Closing) unless the aggregate of all
losses, liabilities, costs and expenses relating thereto for which Seller would,
but for this clause (A), be liable exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal
to 1% of the Purchase Price, and then only to the extent of any such
<PAGE>   76

                                                                              68

excess; (B) Seller shall not have any liability under clause (i) or clause (ii)
of this Section 11.02(a) (in the case of clause (ii), only with respect to
breaches of covenants that occur prior to Closing) for any individual item or
series of related items where the loss, liability, cost or expense relating
thereto is less than $250,000 and such items shall not be aggregated for
purposes of the foregoing clause (A) of this Section 11.02(a); (C) Seller's
liability under clause (i) or clause (ii) of this Section 11.02(a) (in the case
of clause (ii), only with respect to breaches of covenants that occur prior to
Closing) shall in no event exceed 20% of the Purchase Price; and (D) Seller
shall not have any liability under this Section 11.02(a) to the extent the
liability or obligation arises as a result of any action taken or omitted to be
taken by Buyer or any of its Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
limitations of clauses (A), (B) and (C) of the preceding sentence shall not
apply to any employee benefit obligations or liabilities specifically retained
by Seller pursuant to the provisions of Article IX or any Excluded Liabilities.
In no event shall Seller be obligated to indemnify Buyer or any other person
with respect to any matter to the extent that such matter was reflected in the
calculation of the adjustment to the Purchase Price, if any, pursuant to Section
2.02.

           (b) Buyer further acknowledges and agrees that, should the Closing
occur, its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims relating
to this Agreement, any Other Transaction Document, any document or certificate
delivered in connection herewith, the transactions contemplated hereby, the
Clairol Shares, the International Shares, the Acquired Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities or the Clairol Entities or their respective assets, liabilities and
business (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) or any
Federal, state, local or foreign statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation or
otherwise, shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Article XI. In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer hereby waives, from and after
the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any and all
rights, claims and causes of action (other than claims of, or causes of action
arising from, fraud) it or any of its Affiliates (including the Clairol
Entities) may have against Seller and its Affiliates arising under or based upon
this Agreement, any Other Transaction Document, any document or certificate
delivered in connection herewith, or any Federal, state, local or foreign
statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation or
<PAGE>   77

                                                                              69

otherwise (except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Article XI).

           SECTION 11.03. OTHER INDEMNIFICATION BY BUYER. Except as relates to
Taxes, for which the sole indemnification is provided in Section 11.01, Buyer
shall, and shall cause the Buyer Subsidiaries and Clairol Entities to, indemnify
Seller, its Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors,
employees, stockholders, agents and representatives against and hold them
harmless from any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) suffered or incurred by any such indemnified
party to the extent arising from (i) any breach of any representation or
warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered
pursuant hereto, in each case, which survives the Closing, (ii) any breach of
any covenant of Buyer contained in this Agreement or any Other Transaction
Document, (iii) any guarantee or obligation or liability given or made by Seller
or an Affiliate of Seller with respect to any obligation or any Assumed
Liability set forth in clause (iv),(v) or (vi) below (each, a "SELLER
GUARANTEE"), (iv) all Assumed Liabilities, (v) any obligations assumed or
retained by Buyer, the Buyer Subsidiaries or the Clairol Entities pursuant to
Article IX, (vi) all obligations and liabilities of whatever kind and nature,
primary or secondary, direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, known or
unknown, whether or not accrued, whether arising before, on or after the Closing
Date, of the Clairol Entities, including any such obligations or liabilities
under any agreement, lease, license, permit, plan or commitment to which any
Clairol Entity is a party or by which any Clairol Entity or any of its
properties or assets are bound or the Benefit Plans set forth in Section 4.14 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule or any plan, fund, program, policy, contract or
arrangement described in Section 4.14 but not required to be set forth in
Section 4.14 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the "PLANS") (in
each case other than items for which indemnification is provided under Section
11.02), (vii) any discontinuance, suspension or modification on or after the
Closing Date of any Plan and (viii) any claim that the purchase and sale of the
Clairol Shares, the International Shares, the Acquired Assets or the
transactions contemplated hereby give rise to any severance or other benefits
under any Plan.

           SECTION 11.04. LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY; COOPERATION. (a)
Notwithstanding any provision herein,
<PAGE>   78

                                                                              70

neither Seller nor Buyer shall in any event be liable to the other party or its
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents or
representatives on account of any indemnity obligation set forth in Section
11.02 or 11.03 for any indirect, consequential, special, incidental or punitive
damages (including, but not limited to, lost profits, loss of use, damage to
goodwill or loss of business).

           (b) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with each other with respect to
resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one party is obligated to
indemnify the other party hereunder including by making commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claim or liability.

           SECTION 11.05. LOSSES NET OF INSURANCE, ETC. The amount of any loss,
liability, claim, damage, expense or Tax for which indemnification is provided
under this Article XI shall be net of any amounts recovered or recoverable by
the indemnified party under insurance policies with respect to such loss,
liability, claim, damage, expense or Tax (collectively, a "LOSS") and shall be
reduced to take account of any net Tax benefit (including as a result of any
basis adjustment) of the indemnified party arising from the incurrence or
payment of any such Loss. In computing the amount of any such Tax benefit, the
indemnified party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain,
loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the receipt
of any indemnity payment hereunder or the incurrence or payment of any
indemnified Loss. Any indemnity payment under this Agreement shall be treated as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless a final
determination (which shall include the execution of a Form 870-AD or successor
form) with respect to the indemnified party or any of its Affiliates causes any
such payment not to be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for United
States Federal income Tax purposes.

           SECTION 11.06. TERMINATION OF INDEMNIFICATION. The obligations to
indemnify and hold harmless a party hereto (a) pursuant to Section 11.01, shall
terminate at the time the applicable statutes of limitation with respect to the
Tax liabilities in question expire (giving effect to any extension thereof), (b)
pursuant to Sections 11.02(a)(i) and 11.03(i), shall terminate when the
applicable representation or warranty terminates pursuant to Article XIV and (c)
pursuant to Sections 11.02(a)(ii) and 11.03(ii), in each case with respect to
breaches of covenants that occur prior to the Closing, shall terminate eighteen
months after the Closing Date and (d)
<PAGE>   79

                                                                              71

pursuant to the other clauses of Sections 11.02 and 11.03 shall not terminate;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that as to clauses (a), (b) and (c) above such obligations to
indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to any item as to
which the person to be indemnified or the related party thereto shall have,
before the expiration of the applicable period, previously made a claim by
delivering a notice of such claim (stating in reasonable detail the basis of
such claim) to the indemnifying party.

           SECTION 11.07. PROCEDURES RELATING TO INDEMNIFICATION FOR THIRD PARTY
CLAIMS. In order for a party (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement (other than indemnification
for a Tax Claim under Section 11.01 which shall be governed by Section 11.09) in
respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or demand made by any person
against the indemnified party (a "THIRD PARTY CLAIM"), such indemnified party
must notify the indemnifying party in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the
Third Party Claim within 10 business days after receipt by such indemnified
party of written notice of the Third Party Claim; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying party shall have been actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure (except that the indemnifying party shall
not be liable for any expenses incurred during the period in which the
indemnified party failed to give such notice). Thereafter, the indemnified party
shall deliver to the indemnifying party, promptly after the indemnified party's
receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers)
received by the indemnified party relating to the Third Party Claim.

           If a Third Party Claim is made against an indemnified party, the
indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and,
if it so chooses and acknowledges its obligation to indemnify the indemnified
party therefor, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the
indemnifying party; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such counsel is not reasonably
objected to by the indemnified party. Should the indemnifying party so elect to
assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall not be
liable to the indemnified party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof, unless the indemnified
party retains its own counsel due to a mutually agreed upon conflict of
<PAGE>   80

                                                                              72

interest. If the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the indemnified party
shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel
(not reasonably objected to by the indemnifying party), at its own expense,
separate from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it being
understood that the indemnifying party shall control such defense. The
indemnifying party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed
by the indemnified party for any period during which the indemnifying party has
failed to assume the defense thereof (other than during the period prior to the
time the indemnified party shall have given notice of the Third Party Claim as
provided above).

           If the indemnifying party so elects to assume the defense of any
Third Party Claim, all of the indemnified parties shall cooperate with the
indemnifying party in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the indemnifying party's request) the provision
to the indemnifying party of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Whether or not the indemnifying party shall have
assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnified party shall not
admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such
Third Party Claim without the indemnifying party's prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

           SECTION 11.08. PROCEDURES RELATED TO INDEMNIFICATION FOR OTHER CLAIMS
(OTHER THAN TAX CLAIMS UNDER SECTION 11.01). In the event any indemnified party
should have a claim against any indemnifying party under Section 11.02 or 11.03
that does not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be
collected from such indemnified party, the indemnified party shall deliver
notice of such claim with reasonable promptness to the indemnifying party. The
failure by any indemnified party so to notify the indemnifying party shall not
relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to such
indemnified party under Section 11.02 or 11.03, except to the extent that the
indemnifying party demonstrates that it has been materially prejudiced by such
failure.

           SECTION 11.09. PROCEDURES RELATING TO INDEMNIFICATION OF TAX CLAIMS.
(a) If one party is responsible for the payment of Taxes pursuant to Section
11.01
<PAGE>   81

                                                                              73

(the "TAX INDEMNIFYING PARTY"), and the other party to this Agreement (the "TAX
INDEMNIFIED PARTY") receives notice of any deficiency, proposed adjustment,
assessment, audit, examination, suit, dispute or other claim (a "TAX CLAIM")
with respect to such Taxes, the Tax Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the
Tax Indemnifying Party in writing of such Tax Claim. If notice of a Tax Claim is
not given to the Tax Indemnifying Party within a sufficient period of time to
allow such party effectively to contest such Tax Claim, or in reasonable detail
to apprise such party of the nature of the Tax Claim, in each case taking into
account the facts and circumstances with respect to such Tax Claim, the Tax
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Tax Indemnified Party (or, any of
its Affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors, employees,
stockholders, agents or representatives) to the extent that the Tax Indemnifying
Party position is materially prejudiced as a result thereof.

           (b) With respect to any Tax Claim, for which the Tax Indemnified
Party has not waived its rights to indemnification for Taxes under this
Agreement, the Tax Indemnifying Party shall assume and control all proceedings
taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel) and,
without limiting the foregoing, may in its sole discretion pursue or forego any
and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any
taxing authority with respect thereto, and may, in its sole discretion, either
pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where applicable law permits such
refund suits or contest the Tax Claim in any permissible manner; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that in the case of a Tax Claim relating solely to Taxes with respect
to any Clairol Entity for a Straddle Period, Seller and Buyer shall jointly
control all proceedings taken in connection with any such Tax Claim.

           (c) The Tax Indemnified Party and each of its respective Affiliates
shall cooperate with the Tax Indemnifying Party in contesting any Tax Claim,
which cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Tax Indemnifying
Party's request) the provision to the Tax Indemnifying Party of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to such Tax Claim, and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information or explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify at
proceedings relating to such Tax Claim.

           (d) In no case shall Buyer, the Buyer Subsidiaries, the Clairol
Entities or any of their respective
<PAGE>   82

                                                                              74

officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents or representatives settle
or otherwise compromise any Tax Claim without Seller's prior written consent.
Neither party shall settle a Tax Claim relating solely to Taxes of the Company
or the Clairol Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period without the other party's
prior written consent.

                                   ARTICLE XII

                                   TAX MATTERS

          SECTION 12.01. RESPONSIBILITY FOR PREPARATION AND FILING OF TAX
RETURNS AND AMENDMENTS. (a) For any taxable period of the Clairol Entities that
includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, Buyer shall timely prepare and
file with the appropriate authorities all Tax returns, reports and forms
required to be filed and shall pay all Taxes due with respect to such returns,
reports and forms; PROVIDED that Seller shall remit to Buyer not less than ten
(10) days prior to the due date of any such return, report or form any amount
owed by Seller pursuant to Section 11.01 with respect to the taxable periods
covered by such returns, reports or forms. All such returns shall be prepared on
a basis consistent with the past practice of the Clairol Entities and in a
manner that does not distort taxable income provided such basis will not subject
Buyer to any penalties or fines or such basis is otherwise not prohibited by
Applicable Law. Buyer shall furnish such returns to Seller for its approval
(which approval shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld) at least 30 days
prior to the due date for filing such returns.

           (b) For any taxable period of the Clairol Entities that ends on or
before the Closing Date, Seller shall timely prepare and file with the
appropriate authorities all Tax returns, reports and forms required to be filed,
and shall pay all Taxes due with respect to such returns, reports and forms. To
the extent that they relate to the Clairol Entities, all such returns shall be
prepared on a basis consistent with the past practice of Clairol Entities and in
a manner that does not distort taxable income. Buyer and Seller agree to cause
the Clairol Entities to file all Tax returns, reports and forms for the period
including the Closing Date on the basis that the relevant taxable period ended
as of the close of business on the Closing Date, unless the relevant taxing
authority will not accept a return, report or form filed on that basis.
<PAGE>   83

                                                                              75

           (c) Seller shall be responsible for filing any amended, consolidated,
combined or unitary Tax returns for taxable years ending on or prior to the
Closing Date. For those jurisdictions in which separate Tax returns are filed by
the Company or the Clairol Subsidiaries, any required amended returns shall be
prepared by Seller and furnished to the Company or the Clairol Subsidiaries, as
the case may be, for signature and filing at least 30 days prior to the due date
for filing such returns, and the Company or applicable Clairol Subsidiary, as
the case may be, shall promptly sign and timely file any such amended return.

           SECTION 12.02. COOPERATION. Each of Seller, the Seller Entities, the
Clairol Entities and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and representatives
reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all returns, reports and forms
relating to Taxes, including maintaining and making available to each other all
records necessary in connection with Taxes and in resolving all disputes and
audits with respect to all taxable periods relating to Taxes. Buyer and Seller
recognize that Seller and its Affiliates will need access, from time to time,
after the Closing Date, to certain accounting and Tax records and information
held by the Clairol Entities to the extent such records and information pertain
to events occurring prior to the Closing Date; therefore, Buyer agrees, and
agrees to cause the Clairol Entities, (a) to use their best efforts to properly
retain and maintain such records until such time as Seller agrees that such
retention and maintenance is no longer necessary, and (b) to allow Seller and
its agents and representatives (and agents or representatives of any of its
Affiliates), at times and dates mutually acceptable to the parties, to inspect,
review and make copies of such records as Seller may deem necessary or
appropriate from time to time, such activities to be conducted during normal
business hours and at Seller's expense.

           SECTION 12.03. REFUNDS AND CREDITS. Any refunds or credits of Taxes
of the Clairol Entities or Taxes relating to the Acquired Assets for any taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date shall be for the account of Seller.
Any refunds or credits of Taxes of the Clairol Entities or Taxes relating to the
Acquired Assets for any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date shall be
for the account of the Buyer. Any refunds or credits of Taxes of the Clairol
Entities or Taxes relating to the Acquired Assets for any
<PAGE>   84

                                                                              76

Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned between Seller and Buyer. Buyer
shall, if Seller so requests and at Seller's expense, cause the Clairol Entities
to file for and obtain any refunds or credits to which Seller is entitled under
this Section 12.03. Buyer shall permit Seller to control the prosecution of any
such refund claim and, where deemed appropriate by Seller, shall cause the
Clairol Entities to authorize by appropriate powers of attorney such persons as
Seller shall designate to represent the Clairol Entities, as applicable, with
respect to such refund claim, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the prosecution of such
could not give rise to Taxes imposed upon any Buyer Indemnified Person. Buyer
shall cause the Clairol Entities to forward to Seller any such refund to which
it is entitled under this Section 12.03 within 10 days after the refund is
received (or reimburse Seller for any such credit within 10 days after the
credit is allowed or applied against other Tax liability); PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that any such amounts payable to Seller shall be net of any Tax cost or Tax
benefit (including as a result of any basis adjustment) to Buyer or the Clairol
Entities, as the case may be, attributable to the receipt of such refund and/or
the payment of such amounts to Seller. Seller and Buyer shall treat any payments
under the preceding sentence that Seller shall receive pursuant to this Section
12.03 as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless a final determination
(which shall include the execution of a Form 870-AD or successor form) with
respect to the Buyer or any of its Affiliates causes any such payment not to be
treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for United Stated Federal income
Tax purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the control of the prosecution of a
claim for refund of Taxes paid pursuant to a deficiency assessed subsequent to
the Closing Date as a result of an audit shall be governed by the provisions of
Section 11.09.

           SECTION 12.04. SECTION 338(h)(10). (a) SECTION 338(h)(10) ELECTIONS.
Buyer and Seller shall (i) join in making an election under Section 338(h)(10)
of the Code and Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 of the United States Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder (the "TREASURY REGULATIONS") and any comparable election
under state or local Tax law with respect to Clairol, Inc., any U.S. Clairol
Subsidiaries and U.S. legal entity acquired pursuant to these Transaction
Documents (the "ELECTIONS"), (ii) provide to the other party any information
reasonably requested in reasonable detail by such other party to permit the
Elections to be made, (iii) as promptly as practicable following the Closing
Date,
<PAGE>   85

                                                                              77

take all actions reasonably requested in reasonable detail by the other party to
effect and preserve timely Elections (including filing such forms, returns,
elections, schedules and other documents reasonably requested in reasonable
detail by the other party to effect and preserve timely Elections in accordance
with the provisions of Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 of the Treasury Regulations (or
any comparable provisions of state or local tax law)) and (iv) report Buyer's
acquisitions pursuant to this Agreement consistent with such Elections.

           (b) SECTION 338(g) ELECTIONS. Buyer and Seller agree that neither
Buyer nor Seller nor any Affiliate of either thereof shall make any election
pursuant to Section 338(g) of the Code and the United States Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder (or any comparable election under state or
local Tax law) with respect to any International Clairol Subsidiary.

           SECTION 12.05. PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATIONS. (a) ALLOCATIONS OF
PURCHASE PRICE. As soon as practicable following the Closing Date (but in no
event later than sixty (60) calendar days prior to the last date on which an IRS
Form 8023 ("FORM 8023") can be filed to provide for the Elections) Seller shall
prepare and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer and Seller shall agree on (i) an
allocation of that portion of the Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to the
operation of Section 2.02) attributable to the Clairol Shares pursuant to
Section 1.01(d) among the assets of the Company and each U.S. Clairol Subsidiary
and (ii) a completed Form 8023 and the required schedules thereto, providing for
each election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 of
the Treasury Regulations.

           (b) ADJUSTMENTS TO PURCHASE PRICE. Buyer and Seller agree that, to
the extent that the Purchase Price is adjusted pursuant to the operation of
Section 2.02, Buyer and Seller, for all Tax purposes (including for purposes of
completing or amending Form 8023), shall allocate such adjustment to the item or
items to which it is principally attributable.

           (c) PARTIES AGREE TO REPORT THE ELECTIONS, PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATIONS
AND INDEMNITY PAYMENTS CONSISTENTLY. Buyer and Seller agree to file all Tax
returns, reports and forms consistent with the Elections and with the
allocations described in Section 1.01(d) (including the allocations set forth on
Exhibit E) and this Section 12.05 and not to take any position inconsistent
therewith for any Tax
<PAGE>   86

                                                                              78

purpose, unless required by Applicable Law. In addition, Buyer and Seller agree
to treat any indemnity payment under Article XI as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price (as adjusted pursuant to the operation of Section 2.02) for all Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law.

           (d) DISPUTES BY TAXING AUTHORITY. In the event that any of the
allocations described in Section 1.01(d) (including the allocations set forth on
Exhibit E) or this Section 12.05 are disputed by any Taxing Authority, the party
receiving notice of such dispute shall promptly notify the other party in
writing of such dispute, and Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in good faith in
responding to such challenge in order to preserve the effectiveness of such
allocation.

           SECTION 12.06. TRANSFER TAXES. All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
value added, registration and other such Taxes (including all applicable real
estate transfer or gains Taxes) and related fees (including any penalties,
interest and additions to Tax) incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby ("TRANSFER TAXES") shall be shared equally
between Seller and Buyer, and Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in timely making
all filings, returns, reports and forms as may be required to comply with the
provisions of such Tax laws; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that all Transfer Taxes which
are refundable to or otherwise recoverable by Buyer shall be paid solely by
Buyer.

           SECTION 12.07. FIRPTA CERTIFICATE. Seller shall deliver to Buyer at
the Closing a certificate in form and substance satisfactory to Buyer, duly
executed and acknowledged, certifying any facts that would exempt the
transactions contemplated hereby from withholding pursuant to the provisions of
the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act.

           SECTION 12.08. BUYER ACTIVITY POST-CLOSING. Buyer shall not, with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (a) file any amended Tax return with
respect to the Clairol Entities; (b) carry back any loss or other Tax attribute
of the Clairol Entities; or (c) take or advocate any position with respect to
Taxes of the Clairol Entities that reasonably could be expected to adversely
affect Seller or that would have the effect of shifting income to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period unless, in each case, Seller shall have consented in writing to such
action by the Buyer.

         The Procter & Gamble 2001 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan


<PAGE>   2



         THE PROCTER & GAMBLE 2001 STOCK AND INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN


ARTICLE A -- PURPOSE.

       The purposes of The Procter & Gamble 2001 Stock and Incentive
Compensation Plan (the "Plan") are to strengthen the alignment of interests
between those employees of The Procter & Gamble Company (the "Company") and its
subsidiaries who are largely responsible for the success of the business (the
"Participants") and the Company's shareholders through ownership behavior and
the increased ownership of shares of the Company's common stock (the "Common
Stock"), and to encourage the Participants to remain in the employ of the
Company and its subsidiaries. This will be accomplished through the granting of
options to purchase shares of Common Stock, the granting of performance related
awards, the payment of a portion of the Participants' remuneration in shares of
Common Stock, and the granting of deferred awards related to the increase in the
price of Common Stock.

ARTICLE B -- ADMINISTRATION.

         1. The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee (the
"Committee") of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"), or such
other committee as may be designated by the Board. The Committee shall consist
of not fewer than three (3) members of the Board who are "Non-Employee
Directors" as defined in Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the "1934 Act"), or any successor rule or definition adopted by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, to be appointed by the Board from time to
time and to serve at the discretion of the Board. The Committee may establish
such regulations, provisions, and procedures within the terms of the Plan as, in
its opinion, may be advisable for the administration and operation of the Plan,
and may designate the Secretary of the Company or other employees of the Company
to assist the Committee in the administration and operation of the Plan and may
grant authority to such persons to execute documents on behalf of the Committee.
The Committee shall report to the Board on the administration of the Plan not
less than once each year.

         2. Subject to the express provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall
have authority: to grant nonstatutory and incentive stock options; to grant
stock appreciation rights either freestanding or in tandem with simultaneously
granted stock options; to grant Performance Awards (as defined in Article J); to
award a portion of a Participant's remuneration in shares of Common Stock
subject to such conditions or restrictions, if any, as the Committee may
determine; to determine all the terms and provisions of the respective stock
option, stock appreciation right, and stock award agreements including setting
the dates when each stock option or stock appreciation right or part thereof may
be exercised and determining the conditions and restrictions, if any, of any
shares of Common Stock acquired through the exercise of any stock option; to
provide for special terms for any stock options, stock appreciation rights or
stock awards granted to Participants who are foreign nationals or who are
employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries outside of the United States
of America in order to fairly accommodate for differences in local law, tax
policy or custom and to approve such supplements to or amendments, restatements
or alternative versions of the Plan as the Committee may consider necessary or
appropriate for such purposes (without affecting the terms of the Plan for any
other purpose); and to make all other determinations it deems necessary or
advisable for administering the Plan. In addition, at the time of grant the
Committee shall have the further authority to:

      (a)   waive the provisions of Article F, Paragraph 1(a);

      (b)   waive the provisions of Article F, Paragraph 1(b);

      (c)   waive the provisions of Article G, Paragraph 4(a), 4(b) and 4(c);
            and



                                       1
<PAGE>   3

      (d)   impose conditions in lieu of those set forth in Article G,
            Paragraphs 4 through 7, for nonstatutory stock options, stock
            appreciation rights, stock awards, or Performance Awards which do
            not increase or extend the rights of the Participant.

ARTICLE C -- PARTICIPATION.

       The Committee shall select as Participants those employees of the Company
and its subsidiaries who, in the opinion of the Committee, have demonstrated a
capacity for contributing in a substantial manner to the success of such
companies.

ARTICLE D -- LIMITATION ON NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE UNDER THE PLAN.

      1. Unless otherwise authorized by the shareholders and subject to
Paragraph 2 of this Article D, the maximum aggregate number of shares available
for award under the Plan shall be ninety-five million shares. Any of the
authorized shares may be used for any of the types of awards described in the
Plan, except that no more than fifteen percent (15%) of the authorized shares
may be awarded as restricted or unrestricted stock.

      2. In addition to the shares authorized for award by Paragraph 1 of this
Article, the following shares may be awarded under the Plan:

         (a) shares that were authorized to be awarded under The Procter &
Gamble 1992 Stock Plan (the "1992 Plan"), but that were not awarded under the
1992 Plan;

         (b) shares awarded under the Plan or the 1992 Plan that are
subsequently forfeited in accordance with the Plan or the 1992 Plan,
respectively;

         (c) shares tendered by a Participant in payment of all or part of the
exercise price of a stock option awarded under the Plan or the 1992 Plan;

         (d) shares tendered by or withheld from a Participant in satisfaction
of withholding tax obligations with respect to a stock option awarded under the
Plan or the 1992 Plan.

ARTICLE E -- SHARES SUBJECT TO USE UNDER THE PLAN.

         1. The shares to be delivered by the Company upon exercise of stock
options or stock appreciation rights shall be determined by the Board and may
consist, in whole or in part, of authorized but unissued shares or treasury
shares. In the case of redemption of stock appreciation rights by one of the
Company's subsidiaries, such shares shall be shares acquired by that subsidiary.
Notwithstanding any terms or conditions contained herein, the shares to be
delivered by the Company upon exercise of stock options or stock appreciation
rights by a Participant located in Italy shall be authorized but unissued
shares.

         2. For purposes of the Plan, restricted or unrestricted stock awarded
under the terms of the Plan shall be authorized but unissued shares, treasury
shares, or shares acquired in the open market by the Company or a subsidiary, as
determined by the Board.

ARTICLE F -- STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.

         1. In addition to such other conditions as may be established by the
Committee, in consideration of the granting of stock options or stock
appreciation rights under the terms of the Plan, each Participant agrees as
follows:




                                       2
<PAGE>   4

      (a)   The right to exercise any stock option or stock appreciation right
            shall be conditional upon certification by the Participant at time
            of exercise that the Participant intends to remain in the employ of
            the Company or one of its subsidiaries for at least one (1) year
            following the date of the exercise of the stock option or stock
            appreciation right (provided that termination of employment due to
            Retirement or Special Separation shall not constitute a breach of
            such certification), and,

      (b)   In order to better protect the goodwill of the Company and its
            subsidiaries and to prevent the disclosure of the Company's or its
            subsidiaries' trade secrets and confidential information and thereby
            help insure the long-term success of the business, the Participant,
            without prior written consent of the Company, will not engage in any
            activity or provide any services, whether as a director, manager,
            supervisor, employee, adviser, consultant or otherwise, for a period
            of three (3) years following the date of the Participant's
            termination of employment with the Company (except for terminations
            of employment resulting from Retirement or Special Separation), in
            connection with the manufacture, development, advertising,
            promotion, or sale of any product which is the same as or similar to
            or competitive with any products of the Company or its subsidiaries
            (including both existing products as well as products known to the
            Participant, as a consequence of the Participant's employment with
            the Company or one of its subsidiaries, to be in development):

            (1)   with respect to which the Participant's work has been directly
                  concerned at any time during the two (2) years preceding
                  termination of employment with the Company or one of its
                  subsidiaries or

            (2)   with respect to which during that period of time the
                  Participant, as a consequence of the Participant's job
                  performance and duties, acquired knowledge of trade secrets or
                  other confidential information of the Company or its
                  subsidiaries.

            For purposes of this paragraph, it shall be conclusively presumed
            that Participants have knowledge of information they were directly
            exposed to through actual receipt or review of memos or documents
            containing such information, or through actual attendance at
            meetings at which such information was discussed or disclosed.

      (c)   The provisions of this Article are not in lieu of, but are in
            addition to the continuing obligation of the Participant (which
            Participant hereby acknowledges) to not use or disclose the
            Company's or its subsidiaries' trade secrets and confidential
            information known to the Participant until any particular trade
            secret or confidential information become generally known (through
            no fault of the Participant), whereupon the restriction on use and
            disclosure shall cease as to that item. Information regarding
            products in development, in test marketing or being marketed or
            promoted in a discrete geographic region, which information the
            Company or one of its subsidiaries is considering for broader use,
            shall not be deemed generally known until such broader use is
            actually commercially implemented. As used in this Article,
            "generally known" means known throughout the domestic U. S. industry
            or, in the case of Participants who have job responsibilities
            outside of the United States, the appropriate foreign country or
            countries' industry.

      (d)   By acceptance of any offered stock option or stock appreciation
            rights granted under the terms of the Plan, the Participant
            acknowledges that if the Participant were, without authority, to use
            or disclose the Company's or any of its subsidiaries' trade secrets
            or confidential information or threaten to do so, the Company or one
            of its subsidiaries would be entitled to injunctive and other
            appropriate relief to prevent the Participant from doing so. The
            Participant acknowledges that the harm caused to the Company by the
            breach or anticipated breach of this Article is by its nature
            irreparable because, among other things, it



                                       3
<PAGE>   5

            is not readily susceptible of proof as to the monetary harm that
            would ensue. The Participant consents that any interim or final
            equitable relief entered by a court of competent jurisdiction shall,
            at the request of the Company or one of its subsidiaries, be entered
            on consent and enforced by any court having jurisdiction over the
            Participant, without prejudice to any rights either party may have
            to appeal from the proceedings which resulted in any grant of such
            relief.

      (e)   If any of the provisions contained in this Article shall for any
            reason, whether by application of existing law or law which may
            develop after the Participant's acceptance of an offer of the
            granting of stock appreciation rights or stock options, be
            determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be overly broad
            as to scope of activity, duration, or territory, the Participant
            agrees to join the Company or any of its subsidiaries in requesting
            such court to construe such provision by limiting or reducing it so
            as to be enforceable to the extent compatible with then applicable
            law. If any one or more of the terms, provisions, covenants, or
            restrictions of this Article shall be determined by a court of
            competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, then
            the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants, and restrictions
            of this Article shall remain in full force and effect and shall in
            no way be affected, impaired, or invalidated.

         2. The fact that a Participant has been granted a stock option or a
stock appreciation right under the Plan shall not limit the right of the
employer to terminate the Participant's employment at any time. The Committee is
authorized to suspend or terminate any outstanding stock option or stock
appreciation right for actions taken by a Participant prior to termination of
employment if the Committee determines the Participant has acted significantly
contrary to the best interests of the Company or its subsidiaries.

         3. The maximum number of shares with respect to which stock options or
stock appreciation rights may be granted to any Participant in any calendar year
shall not exceed 1,000,000 shares.

         4. The aggregate fair market value (determined at the time when the
incentive stock option is exercisable for the first time by a Participant during
any calendar year) of the shares for which any Participant may be granted
incentive stock options under the Plan and all other stock option plans of the
Company and its subsidiaries in any calendar year shall not exceed $100,000 (or
such other amount as reflected in the limits imposed by Section 422(d) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as it may be amended from time to time).

         5. If the Committee grants incentive stock options, all such stock
options shall contain such provisions as permit them to qualify as "incentive
stock options" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as may be amended from time to time.

         6. With respect to stock options granted in tandem with stock
appreciation rights, the exercise of either such stock options or such stock
appreciation rights will result in the simultaneous cancellation of the same
number of tandem stock appreciation rights or stock options, as the case may be.

         7. The exercise price for all stock options and stock appreciation
rights shall be established by the Committee at the time of their grant and
shall be not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the fair market value of
the Common Stock on the date of grant.

         8. Unless otherwise authorized by the shareholders of the Company,
neither the Board nor the Committee shall authorize the amendment of any
outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right to reduce the exercise
price.

         9. No stock option or stock appreciation right shall be cancelled and
replaced with awards having a lower exercise price without the prior approval of
the shareholders of the Company. This



                                       4
<PAGE>   6

Article F, Paragraph 9 is intended to prohibit the repricing of "underwater"
stock options and stock appreciation rights and shall not be construed to
prohibit the adjustments permitted under Article J of the Plan.

         10. The Committee may require any Participant to accept any stock
options or stock appreciation rights by means of electronic signature.

ARTICLE G -- EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.

         1. All stock options and stock appreciation rights granted hereunder
shall have a maximum life of no more than ten (10) years from the date of grant.

         2. No stock options or stock appreciation rights shall be exercisable
within one (1) year from their date of grant, except in the case of the death of
the Participant.

         3. Unless a transfer has been duly authorized by the Committee pursuant
to Article G, Paragraph 6 of the Plan, during the lifetime of the Participant,
stock options and stock appreciation rights may be exercised only by the
Participant personally, or, in the event of the legal incompetence of the
Participant, by the Participant's duly appointed legal guardian.

         4. In the event that a Participant ceases to be an employee of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries while holding an unexercised stock option or
stock appreciation right:

         (a)      Any unexercisable portions thereof are then void, except in
                  the case of: (1) death of the Participant; (2) Retirement or
                  Special Separation that occurs more than six months from the
                  date the options were granted; or (3) any option as to which
                  the Committee has waived, at the time of grant, the provisions
                  of this Article G, Paragraph 4(a).

         (b)      Any exercisable portions thereof are then void, except in the
                  case of: (1) death of the Participant; (2) Retirement or
                  Special Separation; or (3) any option as to which the
                  Committee has waived, at the time of grant, the provisions of
                  this Article G, Paragraph 4(b).

         (c)      In the case of Special Separation, any stock option or stock
                  appreciation right must be exercised within the time specified
                  in the original grant or five (5) years from the date of
                  Special Separation, whichever is shorter.

         5. In the case of the death of a Participant, the persons to whom the
stock options or stock appreciation rights have been transferred by will or the
laws of descent and distribution shall have the privilege of exercising
remaining stock options, stock appreciation rights or parts thereof, whether or
not exercisable on the date of death of such Participant, at any time prior to
the expiration date of the stock options or stock appreciation rights.

         6. Stock options and stock appreciation rights are not transferable
other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. For the purpose
of exercising stock options or stock appreciation rights after the death of the
Participant, the duly appointed executors and administrators of the estate of
the deceased Participant shall have the same rights with respect to the stock
options and stock appreciation rights as legatees or distributees would have
after distribution to them from the Participant's estate. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Committee may authorize the transfer of stock options and stock
appreciation rights upon such terms and conditions as the Committee may require.
Such transfer shall become effective only upon the Committee's complete
satisfaction that the proposed transferee has strictly complied with such terms
and conditions, and both the original Participant and the transferee shall be
subject to the same terms and conditions hereunder as the original Participant.




                                       5
<PAGE>   7

         7. Upon the exercise of stock appreciation rights, the Participant
shall be entitled to receive a redemption differential for each such stock
appreciation right which shall be the difference between the then fair market
value of one share of Common Stock and the exercise price of one stock
appreciation right then being exercised. In the case of the redemption of stock
appreciation rights by a subsidiary of the Company not located in the United
States, the redemption differential shall be calculated in United States dollars
and converted to the appropriate local currency on the exercise date. As
determined by the Committee, the redemption differential may be paid in cash,
Common Stock to be valued at its fair market value on the date of exercise, any
other mode of payment deemed appropriate by the Committee or any combination
thereof.

         8. Time spent on leave of absence shall be considered as employment for
the purposes of the Plan. Leave of absence means any period of time away from
work granted to any employee by his or her employer because of illness, injury,
or other reasons satisfactory to the employer.

         9. The Company reserves the right from time to time to suspend the
exercise of any stock option or stock appreciation right where such suspension
is deemed by the Company as necessary or appropriate for corporate purposes. No
such suspension shall extend the life of the stock option or stock appreciation
right beyond its expiration date, and in no event will there be a suspension in
the five (5) calendar days immediately preceding the expiration date.

         10. The Committee may require any Participant to exercise any stock
options or stock appreciation rights by means of electronic signature.

ARTICLE H -- PAYMENT FOR STOCK OPTIONS AND TAX WITHHOLDING.

         Upon the exercise of a stock option, payment in full of the exercise
price shall be made by the Participant. As determined by the Committee, the
stock option exercise price may be paid by the Participant either in cash,
shares of Common Stock valued at their fair market value on the date of
exercise, a combination thereof, or such other method as determined by the
Committee. In addition to payment of the exercise price, the Committee may
authorize the Company to charge a reasonable administrative fee for the exercise
of any stock option. Furthermore, to the extent the Company is required to
withhold federal, state, local or foreign taxes in connection with any
Participant's stock option exercise, the Committee may require the Participant
to make such arrangements as the Company may deem necessary for the payment of
such taxes required to be withheld (including, without limitation,
relinquishment of a portion of such stock options or relinquishment of a portion
of the proceeds received by the Participant in a simultaneous exercise and sale
of stock during a "cashless" exercise). In no event, however, shall the
Committee be permitted to require payment from a Participant in excess of the
maximum required tax withholding rates.

ARTICLE I -- GRANT OF UNRESTRICTED OR RESTRICTED STOCK.

         The Committee may grant Common Stock to Participants under the Plan
subject to such conditions or restrictions, if any, as the Committee may
determine. To the extent the Company is required to withhold federal, state,
local or foreign taxes in connection with the lapse of restrictions on any
Participant's shares of Common Stock, the Committee may require the Participant
to make such arrangements as the Company may deem necessary for the payment of
such taxes required to be withheld (including, without limitation,
relinquishment of a portion of such shares of Common Stock). In no event,
however, shall the Committee be permitted to require payment from a Participant
in excess of the maximum required tax withholding rates.

ARTICLE J -- PERFORMANCE RELATED AWARDS.





                                       6
<PAGE>   8

         1. The Committee, in its discretion, may establish performance goals
for selected Participants and authorize the granting of cash, stock options,
stock appreciation rights, Common Stock, other property, or any combination
thereof ("Performance Awards") to such Participants upon achievement of such
established performance goals during a specified time period (the "Performance
Period"). The Committee, in its discretion, shall determine the Participants
eligible for Performance Awards, the performance goals to be achieved during
each Performance Period, the amount of any Performance Awards to be paid, and
the method of payment for any Performance Awards. Performance Awards may be
granted either alone or in addition to other grants made under the Plan.

         2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Performance Awards granted to the
Chief Executive and the Company's other four highest paid executive officers (as
reported in the Company's proxy statement pursuant to Regulation S-K, Item
402(a)(3)) under Article J, Paragraph 1 shall comply with all of the following
requirements:

         (a) Each grant shall specify the specific performance objectives (the
"Performance Objectives") which, if achieved, will result in payment or early
payment of the Performance Award. The Performance Objectives may be described in
terms of Company-wide objectives that are related to the individual Participant
or objectives that are related to a subsidiary, division, department, region,
function or business unit of the Company in which the Participant is employed,
and may consist of one or more or any combination of the following criteria:
stock price, market share, sales revenue, cash flow, earnings per share, return
on equity, total shareholder return, gross margin, and/or costs. The Performance
Objectives may be made relative to the performance of other corporations. The
Committee, in its discretion, may change or modify these criteria, however, at
all times the criterion must be valid performance criterion for purposes of
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
The Committee may not change the criteria or Performance Objectives for any
Performance Period that has already been approved by the Committee. The
Committee may cancel a Performance Period or replace a Performance Period with a
new Performance Period, provided that any such cancellation or replacement shall
not cause the Performance Award to fail to meet the requirements of Section
162(m) of the Code.

         (b) Each grant shall specify the minimum level of achievement required
by the Participant relative to the Performance Objectives to qualify for a
Performance Award. In doing so, the grant shall establish a formula for
determining the percentage of the Performance Award to be awarded if performance
is at or above the minimum level, but falls short of full achievement of the
specified Performance Objectives. Each grant may also establish a formula for
determining an additional award above and beyond the Performance Award to be
granted to the Participant if performance is at or above the specified
Performance Objectives. Such additional award shall also be established as a
percentage of the Performance Award. The Committee may decrease a Performance
Award as determined by the Performance Objectives, but in no case may the
Committee increase any Performance Award as determined by the Performance
Objectives.

         (c) The maximum Performance Award that may be granted to any
Participant for any one-year Performance Period shall not exceed $20,000,000 or
400,000 shares of Common Stock (the "Annual Maximum"). The maximum Performance
Award that may be granted to any Participant for a Performance Period greater
than one year shall not exceed the Annual Maximum multiplied by the number of
full years in the Performance Period.

ARTICLE K -- ADJUSTMENTS.

       The amount of shares authorized to be issued under the Plan will be
adjusted appropriately in the event of future stock splits, stock dividends, or
other changes in capitalization of the Company occurring after the date of
approval of the Plan by the Company's shareholders to prevent the dilution or
enlargement of rights under the Plan; following any such change, the term
"Common Stock" shall be



                                       7
<PAGE>   9

deemed to refer to such class of shares or other securities as may be
applicable. The number of shares and exercise prices covered by outstanding
stock options and stock appreciation rights shall be adjusted to give effect to
any such stock splits, stock dividends, or other changes in the capitalization.

ARTICLE L -- ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS AND DEFINITIONS.

         1. The Board may, at any time, repeal the Plan or may amend it except
that no such amendment may amend this paragraph, increase the total aggregate
number of shares subject to the Plan, reduce the price at which stock options or
stock appreciation rights may be granted or exercised, alter the class of
employees eligible to receive stock options, or increase the percentage of
shares authorized to be transferred as restricted or unrestricted stock.
Participants and the Company shall be bound by any such amendments as of their
effective dates, but if any outstanding stock options or stock appreciation
rights are materially affected adversely, notice thereof shall be given to the
Participants holding such stock options and stock appreciation rights and such
amendments shall not be applicable without such Participant's written consent.
If the Plan is repealed in its entirety, all theretofore granted unexercised
stock options or stock appreciation rights shall continue to be exercisable in
accordance with their terms and shares subject to conditions or restrictions
granted pursuant to the Plan shall continue to be subject to such conditions or
restrictions.

         2. In the case of a Participant who is an employee of a subsidiary of
the Company, performance under the Plan, including the granting of shares of the
Company, may be by the subsidiary. Nothing in the Plan shall affect the right of
the Company or any subsidiary to terminate the employment of any employee with
or without cause. None of the Participants, either individually or as a group,
and no beneficiary, transferee or other person claiming under or through any
Participant, shall have any right, title, or interest in any shares of the
Company purchased or reserved for the purpose of the Plan except as to such
shares, if any, as shall have been granted or transferred to him or her. Nothing
in the Plan shall preclude the awarding or granting of shares of the Company to
employees under any other plan or arrangement now or hereafter in effect.

         3. "Subsidiary" means any company in which more than fifty percent
(50%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock is owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Company or, if the company does not issue stock,
more than fifty percent (50%) of the total combined ownership interest is owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Company. In addition, the Board may designate for
participation in the Plan as a "subsidiary," except for the granting of
incentive stock options, those additional companies affiliated with the Company
in which the Company's direct or indirect stock ownership is fifty percent (50%)
or less of the total combined voting power of all classes of such company's
stock, or, if the company does not issue stock, the Company's direct or indirect
ownership is fifty percent (50%) or less of the company's total combined
ownership interest.

         4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, stock options
and stock appreciation rights granted hereunder shall vest immediately and any
conditions or restrictions on Common Stock shall lapse upon a "Change in
Control." A "Change in Control" shall mean the occurrence of any of the
following:

         (a)      An acquisition (other than directly from the Company) of any
                  voting securities of the Company (the "Voting Securities") by
                  any "Person" (as the term person is used for purposes of
                  Section 13(d) or 14(d) of the Exchange Act), immediately after
                  which such Person has "Beneficial Ownership" (within the
                  meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of
                  twenty percent (20%) or more of the then outstanding shares or
                  the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding
                  Voting Securities; provided, however, in determining whether a
                  Change in Control has occurred pursuant to this Paragraph
                  4(a), shares or Voting Securities which are acquired in a
                  "Non-Control Acquisition" (as hereinafter defined) shall not
                  constitute an acquisition which would cause a Change in





                                       8
<PAGE>   10

                  Control. A "Non-Control Acquisition" shall mean an acquisition
                  by (i) an employee benefit plan (or a trust forming a part
                  thereof) maintained by (A) the Company or (B) any corporation
                  or other Person of which a majority of its voting power or its
                  voting equity securities or equity interest is owned, directly
                  or indirectly, by the Company (for purposes of this
                  definition, a "Related Entity"), (ii) the Company or any
                  Related Entity, or (iii) any Person in connection with a
                  "Non-Control Transaction" (as hereinafter defined);

         (b)      The individuals who, as of July 10, 2001 are members of the
                  Board (the "Incumbent Board"), cease for any reason to
                  constitute at least half of the members of the Board; or,
                  following a Merger (as hereinafter defined) which results in a
                  Parent Corporation (as hereinafter defined), the board of
                  directors of the ultimate Parent Corporation; provided,
                  however, that if the election, or nomination for election by
                  the Company's common stockholders, of any new director was
                  approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the Incumbent
                  Board, such new director shall, for purposes of the Plan, be
                  considered as a member of the Incumbent Board; provided
                  further, however, that no individual shall be considered a
                  member of the Incumbent Board if such individual initially
                  assumed office as a result of either an actual or threatened
                  "Election Contest" (as described in Rule 14a-11 promulgated
                  under the Exchange Act) or other actual or threatened
                  solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a
                  Person other than the Board (a "Proxy Contest") including by
                  reason of any agreement intended to avoid or settle any
                  Election Contest or Proxy Contest; or

         (c)      The consummation of:

                  (i)   A merger, consolidation or reorganization with or into
                        the Company or in which securities of the Company are
                        issued (a "Merger"), unless such Merger is a
                        "Non-Control Transaction." A "Non-Control Transaction"
                        shall mean a Merger where:

                        (A)   the stockholders of the Company, immediately
                              before such Merger own directly or indirectly
                              immediately following such Merger at least fifty
                              percent (50%) of the combined voting power of the
                              outstanding voting securities of (x) the
                              corporation resulting from such Merger (the
                              "Surviving Corporation") if fifty percent (50%) or
                              more of the combined voting power of the then
                              outstanding voting securities of the Surviving
                              Corporation is not Beneficially Owned, directly or
                              indirectly by another Person (a "Parent
                              Corporation"), or (y) if there is one or more
                              Parent Corporations, the ultimate Parent
                              Corporation;

                        (B)   the individuals who were members of the Incumbent
                              Board immediately prior to the execution of the
                              agreement providing for such Merger constitute at
                              least half of the members of the board of
                              directors of (x) the Surviving Corporation, if
                              there is no Parent Corporation, or (y) if there is
                              one or more Parent Corporations, the ultimate
                              Parent Corporation; and

                        (C)   no Person other than (1) the Company, (2) any
                              Related Entity, (3) any employee benefit plan (or
                              any trust forming a part thereof) that,
                              immediately prior to such Merger was maintained by
                              the Company or any Related Entity, or (4) any
                              Person who, immediately prior to such merger,
                              consolidation or reorganization had Beneficial
                              Ownership of twenty percent (20%) or more of the
                              then outstanding Voting Securities or shares, has
                              Beneficial Ownership of twenty percent (20%) or
                              more of the combined voting power of the
                              outstanding voting securities or common stock of
                              (x) the Surviving Corporation if there is no
                              Parent Corporation, or (y) if there is one or more
                              Parent Corporations, the ultimate Parent
                              Corporation;





                                       9
<PAGE>   11

            (ii)  A complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company; or

            (iii) The sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of
                  the assets of the Company to any Person (other than a transfer
                  to a Related Entity or under conditions that would constitute
                  a Non-Control Transaction with the disposition of assets being
                  regarded as a Merger for this purpose or the distribution to
                  the Company's stockholders of the stock of a Related Entity or
                  any other assets).

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not be deemed
to occur solely because any Person (the "Subject Person") acquired Beneficial
Ownership of more than the permitted amount of the then outstanding shares or
Voting Securities as a result of the acquisition of shares or Voting Securities
by the Company which, by reducing the number of shares or Voting Securities then
outstanding, increases the proportional number of shares Beneficially Owned by
the Subject Persons, provided that if a Change in Control would occur (but for
the operation of this sentence) as a result of the acquisition of shares or
Voting Securities by the Company, and after such share acquisition by the
Company, the Subject Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of any additional
shares or Voting Securities which increases the percentage of the then
outstanding shares or Voting Securities Beneficially Owned by the Subject
Person, then a Change in Control shall occur.

         5. The term "Special Separation" shall mean any termination of
employment that occurs prior to the time a Participant is eligible to retire,
except a termination for cause or a voluntary resignation that is not initiated
or encouraged by the Company.

         6. The term "Retirement" shall mean: (a) retirement in accordance with
the provisions of any appropriate retirement plan of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries; or (b) termination of employment under the permanent disability
provision of any retirement plan of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

<PAGE>   2


                      THE PROCTER & GAMBLE 1992 STOCK PLAN
                           (as amended June 12, 2001)

ARTICLE A - PURPOSE.

     The purpose of The Procter & Gamble 1992 Stock Plan (hereinafter referred
to as the "Plan) is to encourage those employees of The Procter & Gamble Company
(hereinafter referred to as the "Company") and its subsidiaries who are largely
responsible for the long-term success and development of the business to
strengthen the alignment of interests between employees and the Company's
shareholders through the increased ownership of shares of the Company's Common
Stock, and to encourage those employees to remain in the employ of the Company
and its subsidiaries. This will be accomplished through the granting to
employees of options to purchase shares of the Common Stock of the Company,
payment of a portion of the employees' remuneration in shares of the Common
Stock, and the granting to them by the Company and a subsidiary, if appropriate,
of deferred awards related to the increase in the price of the Common Stock of
the Company as provided by the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan.

ARTICLE B - ADMINISTRATION.

     1. The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee
(hereinafter referred to as the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of the
Company (hereinafter referred to as the "Board"), or such other committee as may
be designated by the Board. The Committee shall consist of not less than three
(3) members of the Board who are neither officers nor employees, or members of
the Board who are "Non-Employee Directors" as defined in Rule 16b-3 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (hereinafter referred to as the
"1934 Act"), or any successor rule or definition adopted by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, to be appointed by the Board from time to time and to serve
at the discretion of the Board.

     2. It shall be the duty of the Committee to administer this Plan in
accordance with its provisions, to report thereon not less than once each year
to the Board and to make such recommendations of amendments or otherwise as it
deems necessary or appropriate. A decision by a majority of the Committee shall
govern all actions of the Committee.

     3. Subject to the express provisions of this Plan, the Committee shall have
authority: to grant nonstatutory and incentive stock options; to grant to
recipients stock appreciation rights either freestanding, in tandem with
simultaneously granted stock options, or in parallel with simultaneously granted
stock options; to award a portion of a recipient's remuneration in shares of
Common Stock of the Company subject to such conditions or restrictions, if any,
as the Committee may determine; to determine all the terms and provisions of the
respective stock option, stock appreciation right, and stock award agreements
including setting the dates when each stock option or stock appreciation right
or part thereof may be exercised and determining the conditions and
restrictions, if any, of any shares of Common Stock acquired through the
exercise of any stock option; and to make all other determinations it deems
necessary or advisable for administering this Plan; provided, however, the
Committee shall have the further authority at time of grant to:

     (a)  waive the provisions of Article F, paragraph 1(a);

     (b)  waive the provisions of Article F, paragraph 1(b);

     (c)  waive the provisions of Article G, paragraph 4(a); and





                                       1
<PAGE>   3

     (d)  impose conditions in lieu of those set forth in Article G, paragraphs
          4 through 7, for nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation
          rights, and stock award grants which do not increase or extend the
          rights of the recipient,

to take into consideration the differences, limitations, and requirements of
foreign laws or conditions including tax regulations, exchange controls or
investment restrictions, possible unenforceability of any part of this Plan, or
other matters deemed appropriate by it.

     4. The Committee may establish from time to time such regulations,
provisions, and procedures within the terms of this Plan as, in its opinion, may
be advisable in the administration of this Plan.

     5. The Committee may designate the Secretary of the Company or other
employees of the Company to assist the Committee in the administration of this
Plan and may grant authority to such persons to execute documents on behalf of
the Committee.

ARTICLE C -- PARTICIPATION.

     The Committee shall select those employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries who, in the opinion of the Committee, have demonstrated a capacity
for contributing in a substantial manner to the success of such companies and
shall determine the number of shares of the Common Stock of the Company to be
transferred under this Plan subject to such conditions or restrictions as the
Committee may determine and the number of shares with respect to which stock
options or stock appreciation rights will be granted. The Committee may consult
with the Chief Executive, but nevertheless the Committee has the full authority
to act, and the Committee's actions shall be final.

ARTICLE D -- LIMITATION ON NUMBER OF SHARES FOR THE PLAN.

     1. Unless otherwise authorized by the shareholders, the maximum aggregate
number of shares available for award under this Plan for each calendar year the
Plan is in effect shall be one percent (1%) of the total issued shares of Common
Stock of the Company as of June 30 of the immediately preceding fiscal year.

     2. Any of the authorized shares may be used in respect of any of the types
of awards described in this Plan, except that no more than twenty-five percent
(25%) of the authorized shares in any calendar year may be issued as restricted
or unrestricted stock and no more than 50,000,000 of the authorized shares
during the term of the Plan may be issued as incentive stock options.

     3. Any authorized shares not used in a calendar year shall be available for
awards under this Plan in succeeding calendar years.

ARTICLE E -- SHARES SUBJECT TO USE UNDER THE PLAN.

     1. The shares to be delivered by the Company upon exercise of stock options
or stock appreciation rights shall be either authorized but unissued shares or
treasury shares, as determined by the Board. In the case of redemption of stock
appreciation rights by one of the Company's subsidiaries, such shares shall be
shares acquired by that subsidiary. Notwithstanding any terms or conditions
contained herein, the shares to be delivered by the Company upon exercise of
stock options or stock appreciation rights by a participant located in Italy
shall be authorized but unissued shares.

     2. For purposes of this Plan, restricted or unrestricted stock awarded
under the terms of this Plan shall be authorized but unissued shares, treasury
shares, or shares acquired for purposes of the Plan by the Company or a
subsidiary, as determined by the Board.

ARTICLE F -- STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.

     1. In addition to such other conditions as may be established by the
Committee, in consideration of the granting of stock options or stock
appreciation rights under the terms of this Plan, the recipient agrees as
follows:

     (a)  The right to exercise any stock option or stock appreciation right
          shall be conditional upon certification by the recipient at time of
          exercise that the recipient intends to remain in the employ of the
          Company or one of its subsidiaries (except in cases of retirement,
          disability or Special Separation as defined in section 6 of Article G)
          for at least one (1) year following the date of the exercise of the
          stock option or stock appreciation right, and,

     (b)  In order to better protect the goodwill of the Company and its
          subsidiaries and to prevent the disclosure of the Company's or it
          subsidiaries' trade secrets and confidential information and thereby
          help insure the long-term success of the business, the recipient,
          without prior written consent of the Company, will not engage in any
          activity or provide any services, whether as a director, manager,
          supervisor, employee, adviser, consultant or otherwise, for a period
          of three (3) years following the date of the recipient's termination
          of employment with the Company (except for terminations of employment
          resulting from retirement or Special Separation), in connection with
          the manufacture, development, advertising, promotion, or sale of any
          product which is the same as or similar to or competitive with any
          products of the Company or its subsidiaries (including both existing
          products as well as products known to the recipient, as a consequence
          of the recipient's employment with the Company or one of its
          subsidiaries, to be in development):

          (1)  with respect to which the recipient's work has been directly
               concerned at any time during the two (2) years preceding
               termination of employment with the Company or one of its
               subsidiaries or

          (2)  with respect to which during that period of time the recipient,
               as a consequence of the recipient's job performance and duties,
               acquired knowledge of trade secrets or other confidential
               information of the Company or its subsidiaries.

          For purposes of this section, it shall be conclusively presumed that
          recipients have knowledge of information they were directly exposed to
          through actual receipt or review of memos or documents containing such
          information, or through actual attendance at meetings at which such
          information was discussed or disclosed.

     (c)  The provisions of this Article are not in lieu of, but are in addition
          to the continuing obligation of the recipient (which recipient hereby
          acknowledges) to not use or disclose the Company's or its
          subsidiaries' trade secrets and confidential information known to the
          recipient until any particular trade secret or confidential
          information become generally known (through no fault of the
          recipient), whereupon the restriction on use and disclosure shall
          cease as to that item. Information regarding products in development,
          in test marketing or being marketed or promoted in a discrete
          geographic region, which information the Company or one of its
          subsidiaries is considering for broader use, shall not be deemed
          generally known until such broader use is actually commercially
          implemented. As used in this Article, "generally known" means known
          throughout the domestic U. S. industry or, in the case of recipients
          who have job responsibilities outside of the United States, the
          appropriate foreign country or countries' industry.

     (d)  By acceptance of any offered stock option or stock appreciation rights
          granted under the terms of this Plan, the recipient acknowledges that
          if the recipient were, without authority, to





                                       3
<PAGE>   5

          use or disclose the Company's or any of its subsidiaries' trade
          secrets or confidential information or threaten to do so, the Company
          or one of its subsidiaries would be entitled to injunctive and other
          appropriate relief to prevent the recipient from doing so. The
          recipient acknowledges that the harm caused to the Company by the
          breach or anticipated breach of this Article is by its nature
          irreparable because, among other things, it is not readily susceptible
          of proof as to the monetary harm that would ensue. The recipient
          consents that any interim or final equitable relief entered by a court
          of competent jurisdiction shall, at the request of the Company or one
          of its subsidiaries, be entered on consent and enforced by any court
          having jurisdiction over the recipient, without prejudice to any
          rights either party may have to appeal from the proceedings which
          resulted in any grant of such relief.

     (e)  If any of the provisions contained in this Article shall for any
          reason, whether by application of existing law or law which may
          develop after the recipient's acceptance of an offer of the granting
          of stock appreciation rights or stock options, be determined by a
          court of competent jurisdiction to be overly broad as to scope of
          activity, duration, or territory, the recipient agrees to join the
          Company or any of its subsidiaries in requesting such court to
          construe such provision by limiting or reducing it so as to be
          enforceable to the extent compatible with then applicable law. If any
          one or more of the terms, provisions, covenants, or restrictions of
          this Article shall be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
          to be invalid, void or unenforceable, then the remainder of the terms,
          provisions, covenants, and restrictions of this Article shall remain
          in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired, or
          invalidated.

     2. The fact that an employee has been granted a stock option or a stock
appreciation right under this Plan shall not limit the right of the employer to
terminate the recipient's employment at any time. The Committee is authorized to
suspend or terminate any outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right
for actions taken prior to termination of employment if the Committee determines
the recipient has acted significantly contrary to the best interests of the
Company.

     3. More than one stock option or stock appreciation right may be granted to
any employee under this Plan but the maximum number of shares with respect to
which stock options or stock appreciation rights may be granted to any employee
in any calendar year shall not exceed five percent (5%) of the number of shares
which can be issued or transferred annually hereunder.

     4. The aggregate fair market value (determined at the time when the
incentive stock option is exercisable for the first time by an employee during
any calendar year) of the shares for which any employee may be granted incentive
stock options under this Plan and all other stock option plans of the Company
and its subsidiaries in any calendar year shall not exceed $100,000 (or such
other amount as reflected in the limits imposed by Section 422(d) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as it may be amended from time to time).

     5. If the Committee grants incentive stock options, all such stock options
shall contain such provisions as permit them to qualify as "incentive stock
options" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as may be amended from time to time.

     6. With respect to stock options granted in tandem with or parallel to
stock appreciation rights, the exercise of either such stock options or such
stock appreciation rights will result in the simultaneous cancellation of the
same number of tandem or parallel stock appreciation rights or stock options, as
the case may be.

     7. The exercise price for all stock options and stock appreciation rights
shall be established by the Committee at the time of their grant and shall be
not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the fair market value of the Common
Stock of the Company on the date of grant.

ARTICLE G -- EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.

     1. All stock options and stock appreciation rights granted hereunder shall
have a maximum life of no more than fifteen (15) years from the date of grant;
provided, however, that any stock options or stock appreciation rights with a
life of more than ten (10) years from the date of grant that have been
conditionally granted to the Chief Executive or to any other executive officer
subject to the provisions of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and
subject to taxation under United States law, as it may be amended from time to
time, prior to the annual meeting of shareholders scheduled for October 12, 1999
shall automatically be canceled effective October 12, 1999 if the shareholders
do not adopt a resolution at such annual meeting approving grants to such
officers with a maximum life of up to fifteen (15) years from the date of grant.

     2. No stock options or stock appreciation rights shall be exercisable
within one (1) year from their date of grant, except in the case of the death of
the recipient.

     3. During the lifetime of the recipient, stock options and stock
appreciation rights may be exercised only by the recipient personally, or, in
the event of the legal incompetence of the recipient, by the recipient's duly
appointed legal guardian.

     4. In case a recipient of stock options or stock appreciation rights ceases
to be an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries while holding an
unexercised stock option or stock appreciation right:

     (a)  Any unexercisable portions thereof are then void, except in the case
          of: (1) death of the recipient; (2) any Special Separation (as defined
          in section 6 of this Article G) that occurs more than six months from
          the date the options were granted; or (3) any option as to which the
          Committee has waived, at the time of grant, the provisions of this
          Article G, paragraph 4(a) pursuant to the authority granted by Article
          B, paragraph 3.

     (b)  Any exercisable portions thereof are then void, except in the case of
          death, retirement in accordance with the provisions of any appropriate
          profit sharing or retirement plan of the Company or any of its
          subsidiaries, or Special Separation (as defined in section 6 of this
          Article G) of the recipient.

     5. In the case of the death of a recipient of stock options or stock
appreciation rights while an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
the persons to whom the stock options or stock appreciation rights have been
transferred by will or the laws of descent and distribution shall have the
privilege of exercising remaining stock options, stock appreciation rights or
parts thereof, whether or not exercisable on the date of death of such employee,
at any time prior to the expiration date of the stock options or stock
appreciation rights.

     6. Termination of employment under the permanent disability provision of
any appropriate profit sharing or retirement plan of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries shall be deemed the same as retirement. Special Separation means
any termination of employment, except a termination for cause or a voluntary
resignation that is not initiated or encouraged by the Company, that occurs
prior to the time a recipient is eligible to retire. The death of a recipient of
stock options or stock appreciation rights subsequent to retirement or Special
Separation shall not render exercisable stock options or stock appreciation
rights which were unexercisable at the time of the retirement or Special
Separation. The persons to whom the exercisable stock options or stock
appreciation rights have been transferred by will or the laws of descent and
distribution shall have the privilege of exercising such remaining stock
options, stock appreciation rights or parts thereof, at any time prior to the
expiration date of the stock options or stock appreciation rights.




                                       5
<PAGE>   7

     7. Stock options and stock appreciation rights are not transferable other
than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. For the purpose of
exercising stock options or stock appreciation rights after the death of the
recipient, the duly appointed executors and administrators of the estate of the
deceased recipient shall have the same rights with respect to the stock options
and stock appreciation rights as legatees or distributees would have after
distribution to them from the recipient's estate.

     8. Upon the exercise of stock appreciation rights, the recipient shall be
entitled to receive a redemption differential for each such stock appreciation
right which shall be the difference between the then fair market value of one
share of the Common Stock of the Company and the exercise price of one stock
appreciation right then being exercised. In the case of the redemption of stock
appreciation rights by a subsidiary of the Company not located in the United
States, the redemption differential shall be calculated in United States dollars
and converted to the appropriate local currency on the exercise date. As
determined by the Committee, the redemption differential may be paid in cash,
Common Stock of the Company to be valued at its fair market value on the date of
exercise, any other mode of payment deemed appropriate by the Committee or any
combination thereof. The number of shares with respect to which stock
appreciation rights are being exercised shall not be available for granting
future stock options or stock appreciation rights under this Plan.

     9. The Committee may, in its sole discretion, permit a stock option which
is being exercised either (a) by an optionee whose retirement is imminent or who
has retired or (b) after the death of the optionee, to be surrendered, in lieu
of exercise, for an amount equal to the difference between the stock option
exercise price and the fair market value of shares of the Common Stock of the
Company on the day the stock option is surrendered, payment to be made in shares
of the Company's Common Stock which are subject to this Plan valued at their
fair market value on such date, cash, or a combination thereof, in such
proportion and upon such terms and conditions as shall be determined by the
Committee. The difference between the number of shares subject to stock options
so surrendered and the number of shares, if any, issued upon such surrender
shall represent shares which shall not be available for granting future stock
options under this Plan.

     10. Time spent on leave of absence shall be considered as employment for
the purposes of this Plan. Leave of absence means any period of time away from
work granted to any employee by his or her employer because of illness, injury,
or other reasons satisfactory to the employer.

     11. The Company reserves the right from time to time to suspend the
exercise of any stock option or stock appreciation right where such suspension
is deemed by it necessary or appropriate for corporate purposes. No such
suspension shall extend the life of the stock option or stock appreciation right
beyond its expiration date, and in no event will there be a suspension in the
five (5) calendar days immediately preceding the expiration date.

ARTICLE H -- PAYMENT FOR STOCK OPTIONS.

     Upon the exercise of a stock option, payment in full of the exercise price
shall be made by the optionee. As determined by the Committee, the stock option
exercise price may be paid for by the optionee either in cash, shares of the
Common Stock of the Company to be valued at their fair market value on the date
of exercise, a combination thereof, or such other method as determined by the
Committee.

ARTICLE I -- TRANSFER OF SHARES.

     1. The Committee may transfer Common Stock of the Company under the Plan
subject to such conditions or restrictions, if any, as the Committee may
determine. The conditions and restrictions may vary from time to time and with
respect to particular employees or group of employees and may be set



                                       6
<PAGE>   8

forth in agreements between the Company and the employee or in the awards of
stock to them, all as the Committee determines. It is contemplated that the
conditions and restrictions established by the Committee will be consistent with
the objectives of this Plan and may be of the following types. In giving these
examples, it is not intended to restrict the Committee's authority to impose
other restrictions or conditions, or to waive restrictions or conditions under
circumstances deemed by the Committee to be appropriate and not contrary to the
best interests of the Company.

       (a)    Restrictions

              The employee will not be able to sell, pledge, or dispose of the
              shares during a specified period except in accordance with the
              agreement or award. Such restrictions will lapse either after a
              period of, for example, five years, or in fifteen or fewer annual
              installments following retirement or termination of employment, as
              the Committee from time to time may determine. However, upon the
              transfer of shares subject to restrictions, an employee will have
              all incidents of ownership in the shares, including the right to
              dividends (unless otherwise restricted by the Committee), to vote
              the shares, and to make gifts of them to family members (still
              subject to the restrictions).

       (b)    Lapse of Restrictions

              In order to have the restrictions lapse, an employee may be
              required to continue in the employ of the Company or a subsidiary
              for a prescribed period of time. Exemption from this requirement
              may be prescribed in the case of death, disability, or retirement,
              or as otherwise prescribed by the Committee.

ARTICLE J -- ADJUSTMENTS.

       The amount of shares authorized to be issued annually under this Plan
will be subject to appropriate adjustments in their numbers in the event of
future stock splits, stock dividends, or other changes in capitalization of the
Company occurring after the date of approval of this Plan by the Company's
shareholders to prevent the dilution or enlargement of rights under this Plan;
following any such change, the term "Common Stock" shall be deemed to refer to
such class of shares or other securities as may be applicable. The number of
shares and exercise prices covered by outstanding stock options and stock
appreciation rights shall be adjusted to give effect to any such stock splits,
stock dividends, or other changes in the capitalization.

ARTICLE K -- ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS.

       1. The Board may, at any time, repeal this Plan or may amend it from time
to time except that no such amendment may amend this paragraph, increase the
annual aggregate number of shares subject to this Plan, reduce the price at
which stock options or stock appreciation rights may be granted, exercised, or
surrendered, alter the class of employees eligible to receive stock options, or
increase the percentage of shares authorized to be transferred as restricted or
unrestricted stock. The recipient of awards under this Plan and the Company
shall be bound by any such amendments as of their effective dates, but if any
outstanding stock options or stock appreciation rights are affected, notice
thereof shall be given to the holders of such stock options and stock
appreciation rights and such amendments shall not be applicable to such holder
without his or her written consent. If this Plan is repealed in its entirety,
all theretofore granted unexercised stock options or stock appreciation rights
shall continue to be exercisable in accordance with their terms and shares
subject to conditions or restrictions transferred pursuant to this Plan shall
continue to be subject to such conditions or restrictions.

       2. In the case of an employee of a subsidiary company, performance under
this Plan, including the transfer of shares of the Company, may be by the
subsidiary. Nothing in this Plan shall affect the






                                       7
<PAGE>   9

right of the Company or any subsidiary to terminate the employment of any
employee with or without cause. None of the participants, either individually or
as a group, and no beneficiary or other person claiming under or through any
participant, shall have any right, title, or interest in any shares of the
Company purchased or reserved for the purpose of this Plan except as to such
shares, if any, as shall have been granted or transferred to him or her. Nothing
in this Plan shall preclude the issuance or transfer of shares of the Company to
employees under any other plan or arrangement now or hereafter in effect.

       3. "Subsidiary" means any company in which greater than fifty percent
(50%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock is owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Company. In addition, the Board may designate for
participation in this Plan as a "subsidiary," except for the granting of
incentive stock options, those additional companies affiliated with the Company
in which the Company's direct or indirect stock ownership is less than fifty
percent (50%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of such
company's stock.

       4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the this Plan, stock
options and stock appreciation rights granted hereunder shall vest immediately
and any conditions or restrictions on Common Stock shall lapse upon a "Change in
Control." A "Change in Control" shall mean the occurrence of any of the
following:

       (a)    An acquisition (other than directly from the Company) of any
              voting securities of the Company (the "Voting Securities") by any
              "Person" (as the term person is used for purposes of Section 13(d)
              or 14(d) of the Exchange Act), immediately after which such Person
              has "Beneficial Ownership" (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3
              promulgated under the Exchange Act) of twenty percent (20%) or
              more of the then outstanding Shares or the combined voting power
              of the Company's then outstanding Voting Securities; provided,
              however, in determining whether a Change in Control has occurred
              pursuant to this Section 4(a), Shares or Voting Securities which
              are acquired in a "Non-Control Acquisition" (as hereinafter
              defined) shall not constitute an acquisition which would cause a
              Change in Control. A "Non-Control Acquisition" shall mean an
              acquisition by (i) an employee benefit plan (or a trust forming a
              part thereof) maintained by (A) the Company or (B) any corporation
              or other Person of which a majority of its voting power or its
              voting equity securities or equity interest is owned, directly or
              indirectly, by the Company (for purposes of this definition, a
              "Related Entity"), (ii) the Company or any Related Entity, or
              (iii) any Person in connection with a "Non-Control Transaction"
              (as hereinafter defined);

       (b)    The individuals who, as of July 11, 2000 are members of the Board
              (the "Incumbent Board"), cease for any reason to constitute at
              least half of the members of the Board; or, following a Merger (as
              hereinafter defined) which results in a Parent Corporation (as
              hereinafter defined), the board of directors of the ultimate
              Parent Corporation; provided, however, that if the election, or
              nomination for election by the Company's common stockholders, of
              any new director was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of
              the Incumbent Board, such new director shall, for purposes of this
              Plan, be considered as a member of the Incumbent Board; provided
              further, however, that no individual shall be considered a member
              of the Incumbent Board if such individual initially assumed office
              as a result of either an actual or threatened "Election Contest"
              (as described in Rule 14a-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act)
              or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents
              by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board (a "Proxy
              Contest") including by reason of any agreement intended to avoid
              or settle any Election Contest or Proxy Contest; or

       (c)    The consummation of:





                                       8
<PAGE>   10

              (i)    A merger, consolidation or reorganization with or into the
                     Company or in which securities of the Company are issued (a
                     "Merger"), unless such Merger is a "Non-Control
                     Transaction." A "Non-Control Transaction" shall mean a
                     Merger where:

                     (A)    the stockholders of the Company, immediately before
                            such Merger own directly or indirectly immediately
                            following such Merger at least fifty percent (50%)
                            of the combined voting power of the outstanding
                            voting securities of (x) the corporation resulting
                            from such Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") if
                            fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting
                            power of the then outstanding voting securities of
                            the Surviving Corporation is not Beneficially Owned,
                            directly or indirectly by another Person (a "Parent
                            Corporation"), or (y) if there is one or more Parent
                            Corporations, the ultimate Parent Corporation;

                     (B)    the individuals who were members of the Incumbent
                            Board immediately prior to the execution of the
                            agreement providing for such Merger constitute at
                            least half of the members of the board of directors
                            of (x) the Surviving Corporation, if there is no
                            Parent Corporation, or (y) if there is one or more
                            Parent Corporations, the ultimate Parent
                            Corporation; and

                     (C)    no Person other than (1) the Company, (2) any
                            Related Entity, (3) any employee benefit plan (or
                            any trust forming a part thereof) that, immediately
                            prior to such Merger was maintained by the Company
                            or any Related Entity, or (4) any Person who,
                            immediately prior to such merger, consolidation or
                            reorganization had Beneficial Ownership of twenty
                            percent (20%) or more of the then outstanding Voting
                            Securities or Shares, has Beneficial Ownership of
                            twenty percent (20%) or more of the combined voting
                            power of the outstanding voting securities or common
                            stock of (x) the Surviving Corporation if there is
                            no Parent Corporation, or (y) if there is one or
                            more Parent Corporations, the ultimate Parent
                            Corporation;

              (ii)   A complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company; or

              (iii)  The sale or other disposition of all or substantially all
                     of the assets of the Company to any Person (other than a
                     transfer to a Related Entity or under conditions that would
                     constitute a Non-Control Transaction with the disposition
                     of assets being regarded as a Merger for this purpose or
                     the distribution to the Company's stockholders of the stock
                     of a Related Entity or any other assets).

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not be deemed
to occur solely because any Person (the "Subject Person") acquired Beneficial
Ownership of more than the permitted amount of the then outstanding Shares or
Voting Securities as a result of the acquisition of Shares or Voting Securities
by the Company which, by reducing the number of Shares or Voting Securities then
outstanding, increases the proportional number of shares Beneficially Owned by
the Subject Persons, provided that if a Change in Control would occur (but for
the operation of this sentence) as a result of the acquisition of Shares or
Voting Securities by the Company, and after such share acquisition by the
Company, the Subject Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of any additional
Shares or Voting Securities which increases the percentage of the then
outstanding Shares or Voting Securities Beneficially Owned by the Subject
Person, then a Change in Control shall occur.

right, or transfer of shares agreement referable thereto, and the acceptance of

rights were granted prior thereto or to whom shares have been transferred prior

                             ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

1.       SHARES AWARDED AS A PORTION OF REMUNERATION

         Any shares of Common Stock of the Company awarded as a portion of a
participant's remuneration shall be valued at not less than one hundred percent
(100%) of the fair market value of the Company's Common Stock on the date of the
award. These shares may be subject to such conditions or restrictions as the
Committee may determine, including a requirement that the participant remain in
the employ of the Company or one of its subsidiaries for a set period of time,
or until retirement. Failure to abide by any applicable restriction will result
in forfeiture of the shares.

2.       TAX EFFECTS

         INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS

                  With regard to tax effects which may accrue to the optionee,
         counsel advises that if the optionee has continuously been an employee
         from the time an option has been granted until at least three months
         before it is exercised, under existing law no taxable income results to
         the optionee from the exercise of an incentive stock option at the time
         of exercise. However, the spread at exercise is an "adjustment" item
         for alternative minimum tax purposes.

                  Any gain realized on the sale or other disposition of stock
         acquired on exercise of an incentive stock option is considered as
         long-term capital gain for tax purposes if the stock has been held more
         than two years after the date the option was granted and more than one
         year after the date of exercise of the option. If the stock is disposed
         of within one year after exercise, the lesser of any gain on such
         disposition or the spread at exercise (i.e., the excess of the fair
         market value of the stock on the date of exercise over the option
         price) is treated as ordinary income, and any appreciation after the
         date of exercise is considered long-term or short-term capital gain to
         the optionee depending on the holding period prior to sale. However,
         the spread at exercise (even if greater than the gain on the
         disposition) is treated as ordinary income if the disposition is one on
         which a loss, if sustained, is not recognized--e.g., a gift, a "wash"
         sale or a sale to a related party. The amount of ordinary income
         recognized by the optionee is treated as a tax deductible expense to
         the Company. No other amount relative to an incentive stock option is a
         tax deductible expense to the Company.

         NONSTATUTORY STOCK OPTIONS

                  With regard to tax effects which may accrue to the optionee,
         counsel advises that under existing tax law gain taxable as ordinary
         income to the optionee is deemed to be realized at the date of exercise
         of the option, the gain on each share being the difference between the
         market price on the date of exercise and the option price. This amount
         is treated as a tax deductible expense to the Company at the time of
         the exercise of the option. Any appreciation in the value of the stock
         after the date of exercise is considered a long-term or short-term
         capital gain to the optionee depending on whether or not the stock was
         held for the appropriate holding period prior to sale.

         STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS

                  With regard to tax effects which may accrue to the recipient,
         counsel advises that "United States persons," as defined in the
         Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "I.R.C."), must recognize ordinary
         income as of the date of exercise equal to the amount paid to the
         recipient, i.e., the difference between the grant price and the value
         of the shares on the date of exercise.

         SHARES AWARDED AS A PORTION OF REMUNERATION

                  With regard to tax effects which may accrue to the recipient,
         counsel advises that "United States persons" as defined in the Internal
         Revenue Code of 1986 (the "I.R.C."), must recognize ordinary income in
         the first taxable year in which the recipient's rights to the stock are
         transferable or are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture,
         whichever is applicable. Recipients who are "United States persons" may
         also elect to include the income in their tax returns for the taxable
         year in which they receive the shares by filing an election to do so
         with the appropriate office of the Internal Revenue Service within 30
         days of the date the shares are transferred to them.

                  The amount includable in income is the fair market value of
         the shares as of the day the shares are transferable or not subject to
         a substantial risk of forfeiture, whichever is applicable; if the
         recipient has elected to include the income in the year in which the
         shares are received, the amount of income includable is the fair market
         value of the shares at the time of transfer.

                  For non-United States persons, the time when income is
         realized, its measurement and its taxation, will depend on the laws of
         the particular countries in which the recipients are residents and/or
         citizens at the time of transfer or when the shares are first
         transferable and not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, as
         the case may be. "United States persons" who receive shares awarded as
         a portion of remuneration may also have tax consequences with respect
         to the receipt of shares or the expiration of restrictions or
         substantial risk of forfeiture on such shares under the laws of the
         particular country other than the United States of which such person is
         a resident or citizen.

         Notwithstanding the above advice received by the Company, it is each
individual recipient's responsibility to check with his or her personal tax
adviser as to the tax effects and proper handling of stock options, stock
appreciation rights and Common Stock acquired. The above advice relates
specifically to the U.S. consequences of stock options, stock appreciation
rights and Common Stock acquired, including the U.S. consequences to "United
States persons" whether or not resident in the U.S. In addition to U.S. tax
consequences, for all persons who are not U.S. residents, the time when income,
if any, is realized, the measurement of such income and its taxation will also
depend on the laws of the particular country other than the U.S. of which such
persons are resident and/or citizens at the time of grant or the time of
exercise, as the case may be.

         The Plan is not subject to the qualification requirements of Section
401(a) of the I.R.C.

3.       EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974

         The Plan is not subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"), as amended.

4.       INCORPORATION OF CERTAIN DOCUMENTS BY REFERENCE

         The following documents filed by the Company with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (File No. 1-434) pursuant to the 1934 Act are incorporated

                      THE PROCTER & GAMBLE 1983 STOCK PLAN

                      (AS AMENDED EFFECTIVE JUNE 12, 2001)

ARTICLE A - PURPOSE.

      The purpose of The Procter & Gamble 1983 Stock Plan (hereinafter referred
to as the "Plan") is to encourage those key employees of The Procter & Gamble
Company (herein referred to as the "Company") and its subsidiaries who are
largely responsible for the long-term success and development of the business to
increase their proprietary and other interest in the Company's progress, and to
remain in the employ of the Company and its subsidiaries, by the granting to
them by the Company of options to purchase shares of the Common Stock of the
Company and the granting to them by the Company and a subsidiary, if
appropriate, of deferred awards related to the increase in the price of the
Common Stock of the Company as provided in this Plan.

ARTICLE B - ADMINISTRATION.

      1. The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee (herein
referred to as the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of the Company (herein
referred to as the "Board"). The Committee shall operate, administer, and
interpret the Plan and shall be composed of three or more members of the Board
to be appointed by the Board from time to time to serve until they resign, die,
or are removed by resolution of the Board. No member of the Committee shall
participate or be eligible to participate in this Plan, but he or she may
exercise stock options or stock appreciation rights previously granted to him or
her in accordance with the terms of said stock options or stock appreciation
rights.

      2. It shall be the duty of the Committee to administer this Plan in
accordance with its provisions, to report thereon not less than once each year
to the Board and to make such recommendations of amendments or otherwise as it
may deem necessary or appropriate. A decision by a majority of the Committee
shall govern all actions of the Committee.

      3. Subject to the express provisions of this Plan, the Committee shall
have authority: to grant nonstatutory and incentive stock options; to grant to
recipients who are nonresidents of the United States on the date of grant stock
appreciation rights either freestanding, in tandem with simultaneously granted
stock options or in parallel with simultaneously granted stock options; to
determine all the terms and provisions of the respective stock option and stock
appreciation right agreements including setting the dates when each stock option
or stock appreciation right or part thereof may be exercised; and to make all
other determinations it deems necessary or advisable for administering this
Plan; provided, however, for recipients who are nonresidents of the United
States on the date of any grant, the Committee shall have the further authority
to:

          (a)  waive the provisions of Article G, paragraph 1(b);

          (b)  except in the case of a recipient who is an executive officer of
               the Company subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act
               of 1934, waive the provisions of Article G, paragraph 1(a);





                                       1
<PAGE>   3



          (c)  impose conditions in lieu of those set forth in Article J,
               paragraphs 4 through 7, for nonstatutory stock options and stock
               appreciation rights grants which do not increase or extend the
               rights of the recipient, to take into consideration the
               differences, limitations and requirements of local foreign laws
               or conditions including, but not limited to, tax regulations,
               exchange controls, investment restrictions, possible
               unenforceability of any part of this Plan and other similar
               matters deemed appropriate by it.



































                                       2

      4. The Committee may establish from time to time such regulations,
provisions and procedures within the terms of this Plan as, in its opinion, may
be advisable in the administration of this Plan.

      5. The Committee may designate the Secretary of the Company or other
employees of the Company to assist the Committee in the administration of this
Plan and may grant authority to such persons to execute documents on behalf of
the Committee.

ARTICLE C - PARTICIPATION.

      The Committee shall select those key employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries who, in the opinion of the Committee, have demonstrated a capacity
for contributing in a substantial manner to the success of such companies and
shall determine the number of shares with respect to which stock options or
stock appreciation rights are to be granted to each, the type of stock options
or stock appreciation rights to be granted and the number of shares under each
type. The Committee may consult with the Chairman of the Board or the President,
but nevertheless the Committee has full authority to act, and the Committee's
actions shall be final.

ARTICLE D - NUMBER OF STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.

      1. The aggregate number of shares of the Common Stock of the Company which
may be issued or transferred under all stock options to be granted, or with
respect to which stock appreciation rights may be granted, pursuant to this Plan
shall not exceed 25,996,446 shares.

      2. With respect to stock options granted in tandem with or parallel to
stock appreciation rights, the exercise of either such stock options or such
stock appreciation rights will result in the simultaneous cancellation of the
same number of tandem or parallel stock appreciation rights or stock options, as
the case may be.

ARTICLE E - SHARES SUBJECT TO USE UNDER THE PLAN.

      The shares to be delivered by the Company upon exercise of stock options
or stock appreciation rights shall be either authorized but unissued shares or
treasury shares, as determined by the Board. In the case of redemption of stock
appreciation rights by one of the Company's subsidiaries, such shares shall be
shares acquired by that subsidiary.

ARTICLE F - PRICE.

      The exercise price for all stock options and stock appreciation rights
shall be established by the Committee at the time of their grant and shall be
not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the fair market value of the Common
Stock of the Company on the date of grant.

ARTICLE G -   AGREEMENT OF OPTIONEE AND CONDITIONS OF STOCK OPTIONS AND
              STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.

      1. In addition to such other conditions as may be established by the
Committee, in consideration of the granting of stock options or stock
appreciation rights under the terms of this Plan, the recipient agrees as
follows:

      (a)  To remain in the employ of the Company or one of its subsidiaries for
           at least one (1) year following the date of the granting of the stock
           option or stock appreciation right, and,









                                       3
<PAGE>   5

      (b)  In order to better protect the goodwill of the Company and prevent
           the disclosure of the Company's trade secrets and other confidential
           information and thereby help insure the long-term success and
           development of the business, the recipient will not engage in
           competitive employment for a period of three (3) years following the
           date of the granting of a stock option or a stock appreciation right
           without first obtaining written permission from the Company. "Engage
           in competitive employment" means rendering services, or becoming
           associated in any way or in any capacity in the manufacture,
           development, advertising, promotion or sale of any product which is
           the same as or similar to or competitive with any products of the
           Company or one of its subsidiaries (including existing products and
           products known to the recipient to be in development) with respect to
           which the recipient's work has been directly concerned at any time
           during the two (2) years preceding termination of employment with the
           Company or any of its subsidiaries or with respect to which during
           that period of time recipient acquired knowledge of trade secrets or
           other confidential information.

      2. The fact that an employee has been granted a stock option or a stock
appreciation right under this Plan shall not affect or qualify the right of the
employer to terminate the recipient's employment at any time. In the event the
recipient breaches or violates section 1 above, the Company may seek injunctive
or other appropriate relief.

ARTICLE H - LIMITATIONS.

      1. More than one stock option or stock appreciation right may be granted
to any employee under this Plan but the maximum number of shares with respect to
which stock options or stock appreciation rights may be granted to any employee
shall not exceed five percent (5%) of the number of shares which can be issued
or transferred hereunder.

      2. The aggregate fair market value (determined at the time of the grant of
the stock option) of the shares for which any employee may be granted incentive
stock options under this Plan and all other stock option plans of the Company
and its subsidiaries in any calendar year shall not exceed $100,000 plus any
unused limit carry-over to such year as provided for in Section 422A(c)(4) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended. (This amount will automatically
change to reflect the limits imposed by Section 422A(b)(8) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1954 as it may be amended from time to time.)

      3. If the Committee grants incentive stock options, all such stock options
shall contain such provisions as permit them to qualify as "incentive stock
options" within the meaning of Section 422A of the Internal Revenue Code of
1954, as amended by the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, and as the same may
from time to time be amended.

      4. Resale of securities offered under this Plan by Directors and executive
officers of the Company subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 must be pursuant to a valid registration statement on other than Form S-8
or pursuant to an exemption from registration provided under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended. Other employees of the Company or its subsidiaries are free
to make resales of the securities offered hereunder without further
registration.

ARTICLE I - ADJUSTMENTS.

      Appropriate adjustments in the number of shares of stock options and stock
appreciation rights which can be granted under this Plan and in the numbers and
exercise prices covered by outstanding stock options and stock appreciation
rights shall be made to give effect to any stock splits, stock dividends or
other changes in the Common Stock of the Company occurring after October 11,
1983, the date of approval of this Plan by the Company's shareholders.





                                       4
<PAGE>   6

ARTICLE J - EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.

      1. All stock options and stock appreciation rights granted hereunder shall
have a maximum life of no more than ten (10) years from the date of grant.

      2. No stock options or stock appreciation rights shall be exercisable
within one (1) year from their date of grant, except in the case of the death of
the recipient.

      3. During the lifetime of the recipient, stock options and stock
appreciation rights may be exercised only by the recipient personally. Stock
options and stock appreciation rights are not assignable and are not
transferable otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.

      4. In case a recipient of stock options or stock appreciation rights
ceases to be an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries while holding
an unexercised stock option or stock appreciation right:

         (a)  Any unexercisable portions thereof are then void, except in the
              case of death of the recipient or in the case of any option as to
              which the Committee has waived, at the time of grant, the
              provisions of Article G, paragraph 1(a) pursuant to the authority
              granted by Article B, paragraph 3.

         (b)  Any exercisable portions thereof are then void, except in the case
              of death, retirement in accordance with the provisions of any
              appropriate profit sharing or retirement plan of the Company or
              any of its subsidiaries, or Special Separation (as defined in
              section 7 of this Article J) of the recipient.

      5. In the case of the death of a recipient of stock options or stock
appreciation rights while an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
the persons to whom the stock options or stock appreciation rights have been
transferred by will or the laws of descent and distribution shall have the
privilege of exercising remaining stock options, stock appreciation rights or
parts thereof, whether or not exercisable on the date of death of such employee,
at any time prior to the expiration date of the stock option or stock
appreciation right.

      6. Stock options and stock appreciation rights are not transferable other
than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. For the purpose of
exercising stock options or stock appreciation rights after the death of the
recipient, the duly appointed executors and administrators of the estate of the
deceased recipient shall have the same rights with respect to the stock options
and stock appreciation rights as legatees or distributees would have had after
distribution to them from the deceased recipient's estate.

      7. Termination of employment under the permanent disability settlement
provision of any appropriate profit sharing or retirement plan of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries shall be deemed the same as retirement. Special
Separation means any termination of employment, except a termination for cause
or a voluntary resignation that is not initiated or encouraged by the Company,
that occurs prior to the time a recipient is eligible to retire. The death of a
recipient of stock options or stock appreciation rights subsequent to retirement
or Special Separation shall not render exercisable options or rights which were
unexercisable at time of the retirement or Special Separation.

      8. Upon the exercise of stock appreciation rights, the recipient shall be
entitled to receive a redemption differential for each such stock appreciation
right which shall be the difference between the then fair market value of one
share of the Common Stock of the Company and the exercise price of one stock
appreciation right then being exercised. In the case of the redemption of stock
appreciation rights by a subsidiary of the Company not located in the United
States the redemption differential shall be calculated in United States dollars
and converted to the appropriate local currency on the exercise date.



                                       5
<PAGE>   7

As determined by the Committee, the redemption differential may be paid in cash,
Common Stock of the Company to be valued at its fair market value on the date of
exercise, any other mode of payment deemed appropriate by the Committee or any
combination thereof. The number of shares with respect to which stock
appreciation rights are being exercised shall not be available for granting
future stock options or stock appreciation rights under this Plan.

      9. The Committee may, in its sole discretion, permit a stock option which
is being exercised either (a) by an optionee whose retirement is imminent or who
has retired or (b) after the death of the optionee, to be surrendered, in lieu
of exercise, for an amount equal to the difference between the stock option
exercise price and the fair market value of shares of the Common Stock of the
Company on the day the stock option is surrendered, payment to be made in shares
of the Company's Common Stock which are subject to this Plan valued at their
fair market value on such date, cash or a combination thereof, in such
proportion and upon such terms and conditions as shall be determined by the
Committee. The difference between the number of shares subject to stock options
so surrendered and the number of shares, if any, issued upon such surrender
shall represent shares which shall not be available for granting future stock
options under this Plan.

      10. Time spent on leave of absence shall be considered as employment for
the purposes of this Plan. Leave of absence means any period of time away from
work granted to any employee by his or her employer because of illness, injury
or other reasons satisfactory to the employer.

      11. The Company reserves the right from time to time to suspend the
exercise of any stock option or stock appreciation right where such suspension
is deemed by it necessary or appropriate for corporate purposes. No such
suspension shall extend the life of the stock option or stock appreciation right
beyond its expiration date, and in no event will there be a suspension in the
five (5) calendar days immediately preceding the expiration date.

ARTICLE K - PAYMENT FOR STOCK OPTIONS.

      Upon the exercise of a stock option, payment in full of the exercise price
shall be made by the optionee. As determined by the Committee, the stock option
exercise price may be paid for by the optionee either in cash, shares of the
Common Stock of the Company to be valued at their fair market value on the date
of exercise or a combination thereof.

ARTICLE L - ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS.

      1. The Board may, at any time, repeal this Plan and may amend it from time
to time except that no such amendment may amend this paragraph, increase the
aggregate number of shares subject to this Plan or reduce the price at which
stock options or stock appreciation rights may be granted, exercised or
surrendered, or alter the class of employees eligible to receive stock options.
The recipient of stock options and stock appreciation rights and the Company
shall be bound by any such amendments as of their effective dates, but if any
outstanding stock options or stock appreciation rights are affected, notice
thereof shall be given to the holders of such stock options and stock
appreciation rights and such amendments shall not be applicable to such holder
without his or her written consent. If this Plan is repealed in its entirety,
all theretofore granted unexercised stock options or stock appreciation rights
shall continue to be exercisable in accordance with their terms.

      2. In case any stock option or stock appreciation right is surrendered
before exercise or for any reason other than exercise ceases to be exercisable,
except as specifically required by the terms of this Plan, the shares reserved
therefor shall continue to be set aside for, and be subject to, use under this
Plan.

      3. Subsidiary means any company in which greater than fifty percent (50%)
of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock is owned, directly or
indirectly, by the Company. In addition, the Board may designate for
participation in this Plan as a "subsidiary," except for the granting of
incentive stock options, those additional companies affiliated with the Company
in which the Company's direct or indirect stock ownership is less than fifty
percent (50%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of such
company's stock.

ARTICLE M - CONSENT.

      Every recipient of a stock option or stock appreciation right granted
under this Plan shall be bound by the terms and provisions of this Plan and of
the stock option or stock appreciation right agreement referable thereto, and
the acceptance of any stock option or stock appreciation right agreement shall
constitute a binding agreement between the recipient and the Company and its
subsidiaries and any successors in interest to any of them.

ARTICLE N - DURATION OF THE PLAN.

      This Plan will terminate on June 14, 1993 unless a different termination
date is fixed by action of the Board, but all stock options or stock
appreciation rights granted prior thereto may be exercised in accordance with
their terms.

                             ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

1.    TAX EFFECTS

      INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS

           With regard to tax effects which may accrue to the optionee, counsel
       advises that if the optionee has continuously been an employee from the
       time an option has been granted until at least three months before it is
       exercised, under existing law no taxable income results to the optionee
       from the exercise of an incentive stock option at the time of exercise.
       However, the spread at exercise is a "tax preference" item for
       alternative minimum tax purposes.

           Any gain realized on the sale or other disposition of stock acquired
       on exercise of an incentive stock option is considered as long-term
       capital gain for tax purposes if the stock has been held more than two
       years after the date the option was granted and more than one year after
       the date of exercise of the option. If the stock is disposed of within
       one year after exercise, the lesser of any gain on such disposition or
       the spread at exercise (i.e., the excess of the fair market value of the
       stock on the date of exercise over the option price) is treated as
       ordinary income, and any appreciation after the date of exercise is
       considered long-term or short-term capital gain to the owner depending on
       the holding period prior to sale. However, the spread at exercise (even
       if greater than the gain on the disposition) is treated as ordinary
       income if the disposition is one on which a loss, if sustained, is not
       recognized -- e.g., a gift, a "wash" sale or a sale to a related party.
       The amount of ordinary income recognized by the optionee is treated as a
       tax deductible expense to the Company. No other amount relative to an
       incentive stock option is a tax deductible expense to the Company.

      NONSTATUTORY STOCK OPTIONS

           With regard to tax effects which may accrue to the optionee, counsel
       advises that under existing tax law gain taxable as ordinary income to
       the optionee is deemed to be realized at the date of exercise of the
       option, the gain on each share being the difference between the market
       price on the date of exercise and the option price. This amount is
       treated as a tax deductible expense to the Company at the time of the
       exercise of the option. Any appreciation in the value of the stock after
       the date of exercise is considered a long-term or short-term capital gain
       to the owner depending on whether or not the stock was held for the
       appropriate holding period prior to sale.

      STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS

           With regard to tax effects which may accrue to the recipient, counsel
       advises that "United States persons," as defined in the Internal Revenue
       Code of 1986 (the "I.R.C."), must recognize ordinary income as of the
       date of exercise equal to the amount paid to the recipient, i.e., the
       difference between the grant price and the value of the shares on the
       date of exercise. For non-United States persons, the time when income is
       realized, the measurement of such income, and its taxation will depend on
       the laws of the particular country of which such persons are resident
       and/or citizens at the time of grant or the time of exercise, as the case
       may be. There may also be tax consequences with respect to an exercise by
       a United States person under the laws of the particular country other
       than the United States of which such person is a resident and/or citizen.

           Notwithstanding the above advice received by the Company, it is each
      individual recipient's responsibility to check with his or her personal
      tax adviser as to the tax effects and proper handling of stock options,
      stock appreciation rights and Common Stock acquired.

<PAGE>   2



                THE PROCTER & GAMBLE 1993 NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS'
                                   STOCK PLAN
                         (AS AMENDED DECEMBER 12, 2000)


ARTICLE A -- PURPOSE.

         The purpose of The Procter & Gamble 1993 Non-Employee Directors' Stock
Plan (hereinafter referred to as the "Plan") is to strengthen the alignment of
interests between non-employee Directors (hereinafter referred to as
"Participants") and the shareholders of The Procter & Gamble Company
(hereinafter referred to as the "Company") through the increased ownership of
shares of the Company's Common Stock. This will be accomplished by allowing
Participants to elect voluntarily to convert a portion or all of their cash fees
for services as a Director into Common Stock, by granting Participants a fixed
value of shares of Common Stock restricted until retirement (hereinafter
referred to as "Retirement Shares") and by granting Participants non-qualified
options to purchase shares of Common Stock (hereinafter referred to as "Stock
Options").

ARTICLE B -- ADMINISTRATION.

         1. The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee
(hereinafter referred to as the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of the
Company (hereinafter referred to as the "Board"), or such other committee as may
be designated by the Board. The Committee shall consist of not less than three
(3) members of the Board who are "Non-Employee Directors" as defined in Rule
16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any successor
rule or definition adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, to be
appointed by the Board from time to time and to serve at the discretion of the
Board.

         2. It shall be the duty of the Committee to administer this Plan in
accordance with its provisions and to make such recommendations of amendments or
otherwise as it deems necessary or appropriate. A decision by a majority of the
Committee shall govern all actions of the Committee.

         3. Subject to the express provisions of this Plan, the Committee shall
have authority to allow Participants the right to elect to receive fees for
services as a director in either cash or an equivalent amount of whole shares of
Common Stock of the Company, or partly in cash and partly in whole shares of the
Common Stock of the Company, subject to such conditions or restrictions, if any,
as the Committee may determine. The Committee also has the authority to make all
other determinations it deems necessary or advisable for administering this
Plan.

         4. The Committee may establish from time to time such regulations,
provisions, and procedures within the terms of this Plan as, in its opinion, may
be advisable in the administration of this Plan.

         5. The Committee may designate the Secretary of the Company or other
employees of the Company to assist the Committee in the administration of this
Plan and may grant authority to such persons to execute documents on behalf of
the Committee.

ARTICLE C -- PARTICIPATION.

         2. All shares awarded under this Article shall be valued as set forth
in Article I.

ARTICLE G -- STOCK OPTIONS.

         1. The Committee may, from time to time, grant Participants a Stock
Option to purchase shares of Common Stock having an exercise price of one
hundred percent (100%) of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date
of the grant.

         2. The Stock Options shall have a term of fifteen (15) years from the
date of grant, subject to earlier termination as provided herein, and shall be
exercisable three (3) years from the date of grant, except in the case of death,
in which case the Stock Options shall be immediately exercisable.

         3. Stock Options are not transferable other than by will or by the laws
of descent and distribution. Legatees, distributees and duly appointed executors
and administrators of the estate of a deceased Participant shall have the right
to exercise such Stock Options at any time prior to the expiration date of the
Stock Options.

         4. If a Participant ceases to be a Director while holding unexercised
Stock Options, such stock options are then void, except in the case of (i)
death, (ii) disability, (iii) retirement at the end of a term, (iv) retirement
after attaining the age of sixty-nine (69) or (v) resignation from the Board for
reasons of the antitrust laws or the conflict of interest, corporate governance
or continued service policies.

         5. Upon the exercise of a Stock Option, payment in full of the exercise

<PAGE>   4

         The amount of shares authorized to be issued annually under this Plan
will be subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of future stock splits,
stock dividends, or other changes in capitalization of the Company to prevent
the dilution or enlargement of rights under this Plan; following any such
change, the term "Common Stock" shall be deemed to refer to such class of shares
or other securities as may be applicable. The number of shares and exercise
prices covered by outstanding Stock Options and the number of shares to be
granted as Stock Options pursuant to Article F, paragraph 1 shall be adjusted to
give effect to any such stock splits, stock dividends, or other changes in the
capitalization.

ARTICLE I -- TRANSFER OF SHARES.

         1. The Committee may transfer Common Stock of the Company under the
Plan subject to such conditions or restrictions, if any, as the Committee may
determine. The conditions and restrictions may vary from time to time and may be
set forth in agreements between the Company and the Participant or in the awards
of stock to them, all as the Committee determines.

         2. The shares awarded shall be valued at the average of the high and
low quotations for Common Stock of the Company on the New York Stock Exchange on
the day of the transfer to a Participant. All shares awarded shall be full
shares, rounded up to the nearest whole share.

ARTICLE J -- ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS.

         1. The Board may, at any time, repeal this Plan or may amend it from
time to time except that no such amendment may amend this paragraph, increase
the annual aggregate number of shares subject to this Plan, or alter the persons
eligible to participate in this Plan. The Participants and the Company shall be
bound by any such amendments as of their effective dates, but if any outstanding
awards are affected, notice thereof shall be given to the holders of such awards
and such amendments shall not be applicable to such holder without his or her
written consent. If this Plan is repealed in its entirety, all theretofore
awarded shares subject to conditions or restrictions transferred pursuant to
this Plan shall continue to be subject to such conditions or restrictions.

         2. Every recipient of shares pursuant to this Plan shall be bound by
the terms and provisions of this Plan and of the transfer of shares agreement
referable thereto, and the acceptance of any transfer of shares pursuant to this
Plan shall constitute a binding agreement between the recipient and the Company.

         3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the this Plan, stock
options and stock appreciation rights granted hereunder shall vest immediately
and any conditions or restrictions on Common Stock shall lapse upon a "Change in
Control." A "Change in Control" shall mean the occurrence of any of the
following:

          (a)  An acquisition (other than directly from the Company) of any
               voting securities of the Company (the "Voting Securities") by any
               "Person" (as the term person is used for purposes of Section
               13(d) or 14(d) of the Exchange Act), immediately after which such
               Person has "Beneficial Ownership" (within the meaning of Rule
               13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of twenty percent (20%)
               or more of the then



                                       3
<PAGE>   5

               outstanding Shares or the combined voting power of the Company's
               then outstanding Voting Securities; provided, however, in
               determining whether a Change in Control has occurred pursuant to
               this Section 4(a), Shares or Voting Securities which are acquired
               in a "Non-Control Acquisition" (as hereinafter defined) shall not
               constitute an acquisition which would cause a Change in Control.
               A "Non-Control Acquisition" shall mean an acquisition by (i) an
               employee benefit plan (or a trust forming a part thereof)
               maintained by (A) the Company or (B) any corporation or other
               Person of which a majority of its voting power or its voting
               equity securities or equity interest is owned, directly or
               indirectly, by the Company (for purposes of this definition, a
               "Related Entity"), (ii) the Company or any Related Entity, or
               (iii) any Person in connection with a "Non-Control Transaction"
               (as hereinafter defined);

          (b)  The individuals who, as of July 11, 2000 are members of the Board
               (the "Incumbent Board"), cease for any reason to constitute at
               least half of the members of the Board; or, following a Merger
               (as hereinafter defined) which results in a Parent Corporation
               (as hereinafter defined), the board of directors of the ultimate
               Parent Corporation; provided, however, that if the election, or
               nomination for election by the Company's common stockholders, of
               any new director was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of
               the Incumbent Board, such new director shall, for purposes of
               this Plan, be considered as a member of the Incumbent Board;
               provided further, however, that no individual shall be considered
               a member of the Incumbent Board if such individual initially
               assumed office as a result of either an actual or threatened
               "Election Contest" (as described in Rule 14a-11 promulgated under
               the Exchange Act) or other actual or threatened solicitation of
               proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the
               Board (a "Proxy Contest") including by reason of any agreement
               intended to avoid or settle any Election Contest or Proxy
               Contest; or

          (c)  The consummation of:

               (i)  A merger, consolidation or reorganization with or into the
                    Company or in which securities of the Company are issued (a
                    "Merger"), unless such Merger is a "Non-Control
                    Transaction." A "Non-Control Transaction" shall mean a
                    Merger where:

                    (A)  the stockholders of the Company, immediately before
                         such Merger own directly or indirectly immediately
                         following such Merger at least fifty percent (50%) of
                         the combined voting power of the outstanding voting
                         securities of (x) the corporation resulting from such
                         Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") if fifty percent
                         (50%) or more of the combined voting power of the then

                         indirectly by another Person (a "Parent Corporation"),
                         or (y) if there is one or more Parent Corporations, the
                         ultimate Parent Corporation;

                    (B)  the individuals who were members of the Incumbent Board
                         immediately prior to the execution of the agreement
                         providing for such Mergerconstitute at least half of
                         the members of the board of directors of (x) the
                         Surviving Corporation, if there is no Parent
                         Corporation, or (y) if

                         there is one or more Parent Corporations, the ultimate
                         Parent Corporation; and

                         Entity, (3) any employee benefit plan (or any trust
                         forming a part thereof) that, immediately prior to such
                         Merger was maintained by the Company or any Related
                         Entity, or (4) any Person who, immediately prior to
                         such merger, consolidation or reorganization had
                         Beneficial Ownership of twenty percent (20%) or more of
                         the then outstanding Voting Securities or Shares, has
                         Beneficial Ownership of twenty percent (20%) or more of
                         the combined voting power of the outstanding voting
                         securities or common stock of (x) the Surviving
                         Corporation if there is no Parent Corporation, or (y)
                         if there is one or more Parent Corporations, the
                         ultimate Parent Corporation;

              (ii)  A complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company; or

              (iii) The sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of
                    the assets of the Company to any Person (other than a
                    transfer to a Related Entity or under conditions that would
                    constitute a Non-Control Transaction with the disposition of
                    assets being regarded as a Merger for this purpose or the
                    distribution to the Company's stockholders of the stock of a
                    Related Entity or any other assets).

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not be deemed
to occur solely because any Person (the "Subject Person") acquired Beneficial
Ownership of more than the permitted amount of the then outstanding Shares or
Voting Securities as a result of the acquisition of Shares or Voting Securities
by the Company which, by reducing the number of Shares or Voting Securities then
outstanding, increases the proportional number of shares Beneficially Owned by
the Subject Persons, provided that if a Change in Control would occur (but for
the operation of this sentence) as a result of the acquisition of Shares or
Voting Securities by the Company, and after such share acquisition by the
Company, the Subject Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of any additional
Shares or Voting Securities which increases the percentage of the then
outstanding Shares or Voting Securities Beneficially Owned by the Subject
Person, then a Change in Control shall occur.

                    (pages 1-3, 10-35 and inside back cover)

To Our Shareholders:

When we began the 2000/2001 fiscal year, Job One was getting P&G's business back
on track and growing again.

We have refocused on our biggest, and fastest growing brands, in our biggest
markets, with our leading customers. We've strengthened the value of our brands
for consumers. We've made strategic choices about which businesses P&G should be
in, and which it should not. And we've improved P&G's competitiveness by
controlling costs and managing cash more effectively. We believe these are the
choices that will deliver superior Total Shareholder Return, which is the key
measure of our progress and our underlying commitment to P&G shareholders.

MAKING PROGRESS
We've made progress, although there's more to do.

     -    Sales were $39.2 billion, down slightly from last year but up 2%
          excluding the effects of unfavorable exchange rates.

     -    Net earnings were $2.9 billion. Core net earnings, which exclude
          restructuring charges, were $4.4 billion - up 4% -- while earnings per
          share were $3.12, up 6%.

     -    Business trends improved during the year. Fourth quarter unit volumes
          grew 3% and we made significant progress on costs, delivering core
          operating income growth of 12%.

     -    Operating cash flow increased over $1 billion.

Progress in the U.S. - our largest market - is particularly encouraging. A year
ago, only three of our top 10 U.S. brands were growing share; at the end of the
2000/2001 fiscal year, eight of 10 were growing share.

This progress isn't limited to the U.S.

     -    In Latin America, 3% volume growth drove earnings to record levels.

     -    Profits rebounded in China during the year and market shares are now
          growing broadly.

     -    Elsewhere in Asia, we grew volume in virtually every country; in the
          Philippines, for example, our Fabric and Home Care business turned in
          an exceptional year with record volume and profits while regaining
          volume-share leadership for the past six months.

     -    In Central and Eastern Europe, Russia bounced back from the 1998
          economic and currency crises: volume, sales and market shares are all
          rebounding with solid profits.

While we are pleased with this progress, we know we still have a lot of hard
work ahead of us. Diapers and Feminine Protection - both of which are core,

multi-billion-dollar businesses -- are not performing satisfactorily. Western
Europe - our second largest market - also lags expectations. We have
improvements planned for each of these businesses.

GETTING COMPETITIVE

Cost competitiveness improved.

    -   We reduced P&G's overhead costs in 2000/2001 for the first time in five
        years.

    -   We reduced marketing spending in 2000/2001 - for the first time in five
        years.

    -   We reduced capital spending from 7.6% of sales last fiscal year to 6.3%
        this year, and revised our goal to 6% of sales by 2002/2003, one year
        ahead of plan.

We also announced plans to broaden our Organization 2005 restructuring program
to drive costs to best-in- class levels, rationalize our manufacturing capacity
and address under-performing businesses. This includes a reduction in force of
9,600 jobs, in addition to 7,800 remaining from our original Organization 2005
program. We are on track to achieve the nearly $2 billion in savings expected
from this program by fiscal year 2004.

STRATEGIC CHOICES

Last year, we identified the need to make clearer, tougher choices. Again, we've
made progress. Here's where P&G will focus:

     1.   BUILD EXISTING CORE BUSINESSES INTO STRONGER GLOBAL LEADERS. Baby
          Care, Fabric Care, Feminine Protection and Hair Care are our
          top-priority core businesses. These are categories in which P&G is #1
          in global sales and market share, and where the Company believes it
          can consistently grow earnings at double-digit rates. Together, these
          four businesses represent about two-thirds of P&G sales and an even
          greater percentage of profit.

     2.   GROW BIG BRANDS, BIG COUNTRIES, LEADING CUSTOMERS. With this focus, we
          intend to grow sales, market shares and profits at rates that exceed
          Company averages. We'll concentrate on our billion-dollar and
          soon-to-be billion-dollar brands, and on our top customers in our top
          10 countries.

     3.   DEVELOP FASTER-GROWING, HIGHER-MARGIN, MORE ASSET-EFFICIENT BUSINESSES
          WITH GLOBAL LEADERSHIP POTENTIAL. These are businesses - such as
          Personal Health Care and Beauty Care - that are high Total Shareholder
          Return performers. We'll develop them through internal innovation, as
          we're doing with Crest Whitestrips, and through acquisitions and
          alliances that are in or adjacent to core P&G categories, such as
          Clairol, which we announced our intention to acquire in May.

     4.   REGAIN GROWTH MOMENTUM AND LEADERSHIP IN WESTERN EUROPE. We'll restore
          P&G leadership in Western Europe by focusing on core categories and on
          our biggest brands, leading customers, biggest countries.

     5.   DRIVE GROWTH IN KEY DEVELOPING MARKETS. We expect growth in the coming
          decade to come from a balanced mix of developed and developing
          markets. We'll win in our high-priority developing markets by
          tailoring low-income offerings in core P&G categories.

In all these areas, innovation will continue to be the primary driver of P&G
growth. We intend to be the innovation leader in new and established businesses
alike, and in both developed and developing markets.

In 2000, for example, P&G had five of the top new U.S. consumer products, as
reported in the Information Resources, Inc. (IRI) annual study. Over the past
eight years, we have averaged three to four of the top 10 new items each year.
In fact, over the last four years, P&G has launched 13 new products in the U.S.,
each of which has exceeded $100 million in sales - nearly a third of all new
consumer products during that time that beat the $100 million mark.

                                                                           THREE

Importantly, P&G innovation doesn't stop with products. We define innovation
broadly, and consistently strive to innovate in every part of the business --
with new business models, such as Reflect.com; new organization models, such as
the Global Business Services shared- service organization; and new approaches to
consumer and customer marketing. Innovation is a deliberate process at P&G. We

                                FINANCIAL REVIEW

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Fiscal 2001 was a year of progress - in making choices, establishing realistic
goals and delivering on commitments. The Company also made considerable progress
on strengthening its cost structure and improving cash efficiency. This was
despite a tough year that included weakening economies in some major
geographies, significant currency impacts, rising commodity prices and an
increasingly competitive environment.

To accelerate long-term growth, the Company has made and will continue to make
tough, clear choices about where to play and how to win. The Company is focused
on building superior shareholder return - by creating and building big brands
with top-line results, sales margins and cash flow at the best competitive
benchmarks.

During the past year, the Company refocused on its core categories to develop
high-margin growth businesses with global leadership potential. The Company also
expanded its restructuring program, initiated in June 1999, in conjunction with
Organization 2005, to drive further enrollment reductions and address
under-performing businesses. These actions are critical to delivering on the
Company's long-term goals to consistently grow earnings and earnings per share
at double-digit rates.

NET EARNINGS
Reported net earnings were $2.92 billion or $2.07 per share in 2001. This
compared to $3.54 billion or $2.47 per share in 2000, and $3.76 billion or $2.59
per share in 1999. Current year results include charges of $1.48 billion after
tax for restructuring program costs. These costs were $688 million and $385
million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. This program covers a significant
reduction in enrollment, manufacturing consolidations and portfolio choices to
scale back or discontinue under-performing businesses and initiatives.


Core net earnings, which exclude restructuring program costs, increased to $4.40
billion in 2001 from $4.23 billion in 2000 and $4.15 billion in 1999. Core net
earnings per share were $3.12, compared to $2.95 per share in 2000 and $2.85 per
share in 1999. Core net earnings per share increased 6% in 2001, compared to 4%
in 2000. Core net earnings progress was significant in light of product cost
increases and exchange impacts, which were offset by pricing benefits, lower
taxes and gains from the divestiture of non- strategic brands. Growth in the
prior year was affected by significant investments in new initiatives.

NET SALES
Reported net sales were $39.24 billion, compared to $39.95 billion in 2000 and
$38.13 billion in 1999. Excluding an unfavorable exchange rate impact of over 3%
in the current year, net sales grew 2%, reflecting improved pricing in beauty
care, fabric and home care and paper, primarily family care. Unit volume was
flat in 2001, as exceptionally strong performance by new businesses in health
care was offset by softness in food and beverage. Unit volume grew 4% in 2000,
while net sales excluding a 2% unfavorable exchange impact increased 7%. This
growth reflected strong product initiative activity, the acquisition of the Iams
pet health and nutrition business and progress on flagship brands, largely in
fabric and home care.

OPERATING COSTS
Consistent with its commitment to reduce its cost structure to more competitive
levels, in the fourth quarter, the Company broadened its restructuring program
to deliver further cost reductions by reducing overheads, consolidating
manufacturing operations and addressing under-performing businesses and
initiatives. Given the nature and magnitude of the charges related to this
program, the following discussions include supplemental information on a "core"
basis - excluding restructuring charges.

Cost of products sold was $22.10 billion in 2001, compared to $21.51 billion and
$21.03 billion in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Restructuring costs included in
cost of products sold were $1.14 billion in 2001, $496 million in 2000 and $443
million in 1999. Excluding restructuring charges, cost of products sold was flat
versus the prior year, as a disciplined cost focus overcame commodity cost
increases, such as energy. Core cost of products sold was up 2% in 2000.

Marketing, research and administrative expense was $12.41 billion versus $12.48
billion in 2000 and $10.85 billion in 1999. These include restructuring costs of
$583 million in 2001, $318 million in 2000 and $38 million in 1999, primarily
due to employee separation expenses. Excluding restructuring charges, marketing,
research and administrative expense was $11.82 billion in the current year
versus $12.17 billion in 2000 and $10.81 billion in 1999. As a percent of net
sales, this was 30.0% in 2001, 30.4% in 2000 and 28.3% in 1999. The decrease in
the current year was due to a reduction in overhead costs, as well as marketing
support efficiencies. The increase in 2000 reflects the high level of initiative
investment.

MARGINS
In 2001, gross margin was 43.7%, compared to 46.1% in 2000 and 44.8% in 1999.
Gross margin included restructuring charges that consisted primarily of
accelerated depreciation, asset write-downs and employee separation costs for
manufacturing employees.

Excluding these charges, gross margin was 46.8%, 47.4% and 46.0% in 2001, 2000
and 1999, respectively, reflecting rising material costs despite the benefit of
pricing actions and effective cost management.

Operating margin was 12.1%, compared to 14.9% in 2000 and 16.4% in 1999.
Excluding restructuring charges, core operating margin was 16.7%, compared to
16.9% in 2000 and 17.7% in 1999.

Net earnings margin was 7.4% versus 8.9% in 2000 and 9.9% in 1999. Excluding
restructuring charges, core net earnings margin was 11.2%, up from 10.6% in 2000
and 10.9% in 1999. The margin increase in 2001 reflects the gains from minor
brand divestitures and lower taxes, partially offset by increased product costs
and unfavorable exchange impacts. In 2000, the core net earnings margin
decreased, reflecting increased spending, primarily from initiative investments.

NON-OPERATING ITEMS
Interest expense was $794 million in 2001, compared to $722 million in 2000 and
$650 million in 1999. The interest expense trend reflects higher average debt
levels, primarily due to share repurchases and acquisitions.

Other income, net, which consists primarily of interest and investment income
and divestiture gains contributed $674 million, compared to $304 million in 2000
and $235 million in 1999. Increased gains from the divestiture of minor brands
drove the year- to-year changes.

The Company's effective tax rate for the current year was 36.7%, compared to
36.0% in 2000 and 35.5% in 1999. Excluding restructuring costs and related tax
effects, the effective tax rate was 32.0%, compared to 33.4% in 2000 and 34.4%
in 1999. This change reflects the continuing benefit of the implementation of
the Company's new global business unit structure.

                          FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)


FINANCIAL CONDITION
One of the Company's focus areas is to improve its cash efficiency as a key
element of achieving superior shareholder return.


CASH
Operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds to finance operating
needs, capital expenditures and shareholder dividends. This is supplemented by
additional borrowings to provide funds to finance the share repurchase program
and acquisitions.

Cash flow from operations was $5.80 billion, $4.68 billion and $5.54 billion in
2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Operating cash flow trends were primarily
impacted by working capital changes, including the impact of restructuring
program accruals.

Cash and cash equivalents increased $891 million in the current year to $2.31
billion, reflecting reduced capital expenditures and improved working capital.
Cash and cash equivalents were $1.42 billion in 2000 and $2.29 billion in 1999.
The decrease in 2000 reflected acquisition spending and lower net earnings,
partially offset by the issuance of debt.

Net cash used for acquisitions completed during 2001 totaled $138 million. This
compares to acquisition spending of $2.97 billion in 2000 and $137 million in
1999. Spending in fiscal 2000 was primarily related to the acquisitions of The
Iams Company and Affiliates, Recovery Engineering, Inc. and a joint venture
ownership increase in China. In May 2001, the Company announced its intent to
acquire the Clairol business, pending regulatory clearance. A substantial
portion of the $4.95 billion purchase price will be financed with debt.

The Company continues its program to divest certain non-strategic brands in
order to focus resources on core businesses. The proceeds from these and other
asset sales generated $788 million in cash flow in the current year, compared to
$419 million and $434 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively.

The Company maintains a share repurchase program, which authorizes the purchase
of shares annually on the open market to mitigate the dilutive impact of
employee compensation programs. The Company also has a discretionary buy-back
program under which it may repurchase additional outstanding shares. Current
year purchases under the combined programs were $1.25 billion, compared to $1.77
billion in 2000 and $2.53 billion in 1999. The Company issued equity put options
in 2001 for one million shares at approximately $74 per share and for 12 million
shares at prices ranging from $60 to $71 per share in 2000, which reduce the
Company's cash outlay for share repurchases.

Common share dividends grew 9% to $1.40 per share in 2001, compared to $1.28 and
$1.14 in 2000 and 1999, respectively. For the coming year, the annual dividend
rate will increase to $1.52 per common share, marking the 46th consecutive year
of increased common share dividend payments. Total dividend payments, to both
common and preferred shareholders, were $1.94 billion, $1.80 billion and $1.63
billion in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Total debt was fairly stable at $12.03 billion at June 30, 2001 and $12.25

components, including issuance of long-term debt, reductions in short-term debt,
currency effects and mark-to-market impacts of derivative financial instruments.

September 1999, was $489 million at June 30, 2001. Additionally, the Company is
able to issue commercial paper at favorable rates and to access general bank
financing.


CAPITAL SPENDING
Significant progress was made in 2001, as capital expenditures decreased to
$2.49 billion compared to $3.02 billion in 2000 and $2.83 billion in 1999.
Current year spending is 6.3% of net sales, compared to 7.6% and 7.4% in 2000
and 1999. During 2001, capital spending declined in most segments due to more
choiceful investments, increased efficiencies and favorable currency impacts.
The Company has revised its goal to reduce capital spending to 6% of net sales
by fiscal 2003, one year ahead of plan.

The following pages provide perspective on the Company's business segments.
Product-based segment results exclude items that are not included in measuring
business performance for management reporting purposes, most notably certain
financing, investing and employee benefit costs, goodwill amortization and
restructuring costs.

Sales in companies over which the Company exerts significant influence, but does
not control the financial and operating decisions, are reported for segment
purposes in a manner similar to consolidated subsidiaries. Taxes are reflected
in the business segments at local statutory tax rates. The effects of these
conventions are eliminated in the corporate segment to adjust management
reporting conventions to accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

FABRIC AND HOME CARE
Fabric and home care trends reflect the significant effort to restore historical
margins through innovation combined with necessary pricing, disciplined cost
focus and more efficient marketing. Net sales were $11.66 billion, down 4%
versus a strong year ago base which included new brand introductions. Excluding
a 3% unfavorable foreign exchange impact, net sales decreased 1%. Unit volume
decreased 2% due to heavy competitive activity, primarily in Western Europe.

Despite the volume decline, net earnings increased 13% to $1.64 billion. Net
earnings growth was significant in light of product cost increases and exchange
impacts, which were offset by the benefits of laundry pricing actions and lower
taxes. Latin America delivered particularly strong earnings progress, reflecting
disciplined cost management.

Fabric and home care is the Company's most profitable segment, accounting for
nearly a third of net sales and an even greater percentage of profits.

                          FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)


The Company is committed to strengthening the business in Western Europe.
Strategic plans are in place to improve the business through a differentiated
portfolio of brands that provide superior value, meet a variety of consumer
needs and build to a total leadership position.

In 2000, net sales for fabric and home care were $12.16 billion, an increase of
7% over 1999. Excluding unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, primarily in
Western Europe, net sales grew 9% on 5% unit volume growth. Top-line growth was
spurred by the introduction of new brands and solid base business performance.
Net earnings for the segment were $1.45 billion, down 3% versus the prior year,
primarily due to investments in product initiatives.


PAPER
The paper segment, which includes baby, feminine and family care, reflected
mixed results. Net sales were $11.99 billion, compared to $12.04 billion in
2000. Excluding a 4% negative impact of exchange rates, primarily the euro, net
sales increased 4%. Unit volume grew 2%, driven by family care and baby care.
Commodity- related cost increases and weaker foreign currencies resulted in net
earnings decreasing 2% to $1.04 billion, despite progress in family care and
feminine care. These were partially offset by pricing actions and lower overhead
and marketing spending.

Family care volume grew 3% due to new product introductions and base business
growth in North America. Net sales increased 10%, excluding a 2% unfavorable
impact of exchange, resulting from commodity-driven global pricing actions on
Charmin and Bounty.

Baby care volume increased 3% driven by Latin America and Central and Eastern
Europe. Excluding a 5% negative exchange impact, net sales increased 1%.


Feminine care volume declined 3% due to a challenging competitive environment in
North America and Northeast Asia, partially offset by growth in developing
markets. Net sales were comparable to the prior year - excluding a 5% negative
exchange impact.

In 2000, paper segment net sales were $12.04 billion, down 1% from the prior
year on flat unit volume. Excluding the impact of exchange rates, primarily the
euro, net sales were up 1%. Excluding the impact of the Attends divestiture in
1999, unit volume increased 2%. Net earnings were $1.07 billion, down 16%,
reflecting family care expansion in Western Europe, investments in new product
initiatives on Charmin, a tough competitive environment in baby care and
feminine care businesses, increased capacity and unfavorable raw and packing
material cost trends.

Looking forward, initiative programs are currently underway to drive future
growth. Though challenges remain, a continued focus on innovation and cost
reductions should lead to stronger performance.


BEAUTY CARE
Beauty care increased profitability behind innovative, high-margin, global
brands. Net sales were $7.26 billion, down 2% versus $7.39 billion in 2000.
Excluding a 4% impact of unfavorable exchange rates, primarily in Western Europe
and Asia, net sales increased 2%. Unit volume was down 1% versus the prior year.
Excluding the impact of divestitures, volume was flat. Volume growth in hair
care and skin care was offset by competitive activity in deodorants and bar
soaps. Net earnings were $972 million, a 9% improvement behind the successful
expansion of high-performance, premium- priced products.

Positive results in hair care were primarily driven by the global restage of
Pantene and Head & Shoulders. Latin America, in particular, posted record
results on double-digit top-line growth.

                          FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)

Skin care delivered record net sales and share growth led by the launch of Olay
Daily Facials and Olay Total Effects.

In the past year, Cover Girl has built share in the United States behind
superior products. The cosmetics business posted strong results behind recently
launched Cover Girl Outlast and Max Factor Lipfinity, breakthrough long-wearing
lipsticks.

During the year, the Company announced the intent to acquire the Clairol
business, a world leader in hair color and hair care products with prominent
brands such as Herbal Essences, Aussie, Infusium, Nice `n Easy and Natural
Instincts. The pending Clairol acquisition will represent the Company's entry
into the fast growing hair- colorant category.

In 2000, net sales were $7.39 billion, comparable to the prior year, but up 1%
excluding the impact of unfavorable exchange rates, primarily in Western Europe.
Unit volume declined 2%, impacted by a difficult competitive environment in key
European markets and significant contraction of the market in China. Net
earnings were $894 million, a 3% decrease from the prior year due to initiative
investments.

HEALTH CARE
Health care delivered exceptional growth on the expansion of new products. Net
sales were $4.35 billion, up 11%. Excluding a 3% unfavorable exchange impact,
net sales grew 14%. Unit volume increased 15%, driven by the excellent
performance of Iams pet health and nutrition, pharmaceuticals and oral care
businesses. Net earnings were $390 million, a 16% increase over fiscal 2000,
consistent with volume growth.

Health care net sales in North America grew behind volume progress on the
strength of new businesses.

The Iams Company and Affiliates again posted record results, with net sales up
double-digits behind continued growth in North America and expansion into new
retail channels in the United Kingdom, Italy and Japan.

Pharmaceutical net sales grew primarily due to the strength of Actonel, the
Company's post-menopausal osteoporosis drug, which achieved $150 million in
total global sales. Actonel was launched in 2000 and is now approved in 47
countries and currently marketed in 30 countries.

Oral care top-line growth reflected the benefits of broadening the appeal of
core brands beyond cavity and tartar protection into new whitening and cleaning
products. Crest Whitestrips and Crest Spinbrush are driving the trends toward
at-home whitening and powered brushing, respectively.

Western Europe health care net sales were below year ago, primarily due to the
weak euro. The expansion of Crest Spinbrush and the continued growth of Actonel
are expected to improve Western Europe results next year.

In 2000, health care net sales were $3.91 billion, with growth resulting
primarily from acquisitions. Volume and net sales increased 34% and 36%,
respectively, versus the prior year. Unfavorable exchange rates impacted net
sales by 2%. Net earnings were $335 million, a 38% increase over 1999.

                          FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)


FOOD AND BEVERAGE
Food and beverage results were below year ago, as strong sales and earnings in
coffee were offset by soft snacks and juice results. Net sales were $4.14
billion, down 11%. Excluding a 1% impact of divestitures and a 2% unfavorable
foreign exchange impact, net sales declined 8%. Unit volume declined 10%
including a 2% impact from divestitures. Unit volume was negatively affected by
reduced trade merchandising and snacks pricing actions in North America and
Western Europe, and the divestiture of institutional shortening and oils. Net
earnings were $333 million, down 9% versus last year.

The coffee business had a record year with Folgers achieving its strongest
volume increase in a decade.

In snacks and juice, North America results are showing signs of stabilizing as
merchandising returned to competitive levels. Lower net earnings in Western
Europe were primarily due to investments in Sunny Delight and the impact of a
strong U.S. dollar.

During the year, P&G and The Coca-Cola Company announced the intent to form a
new venture to maximize the growth potential of the snacks and juice business on
a global basis. Both parties are committed to completing a mutually-agreed
transaction; however, the parties anticipate that any transaction will likely
contain terms different from those announced previously. The Company also
separately announced its intent to explore strategic options for its peanut
butter and retail shortening and oils business.

In 2000, net sales were flat versus the prior year at $4.63 billion, including a
1% negative exchange impact. Unit volume also was flat. Excluding the 1999
divestiture of Hawaiian Punch, unit volume increased 5% behind strong growth in
Western Europe and Northeast Asia, partially due to the expansion of Pringles.
Net earnings increased to $364 million, up 11% versus the previous year,
primarily due to gross margin improvement.


CORPORATE
The corporate segment includes both operating and non-operating elements such as
financing and investing activities, goodwill amortization, employee benefit
costs, charges related to restructuring, segment eliminations and other general
corporate items.

Corporate includes adjustments from management reporting conventions to conform
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These primarily affect the treatment of unconsolidated investees and income
taxes, which are reflected in the business segments using applicable local
statutory tax rates.

Corporate results reflect one-time gains from the Company's non- strategic brand
divestiture program, increased restructuring costs, reduced overhead spending
and corporate hedging gains, partially offset by higher employee benefit costs,
and certain tax impacts not reflected in the business segments.


HEDGING AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company is exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates,
currency exchange rates and commodity prices. To manage the volatility relating
to these exposures, the Company nets the exposures on a consolidated basis to
take advantage of natural offsets. For the residual portion, the Company enters
into various derivative transactions pursuant to the Company's hedging policies.
The financial impacts of these hedging instruments are offset in part or in
whole by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged. The
Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading
purposes. Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements includes a discussion
of the Company's accounting policies for financial instruments.

<PAGE>   12
                  The Procter & Gamble Company and Subsidiaries               17

                          FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)

Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market value,
sensitivity analysis and value at risk modeling. The tests for interest rate and
currency rate exposures discussed below are based on a Monte Carlo simulation
value at risk model using a one year horizon and a 95% confidence level. The
model incorporates the impact of correlation and diversification from holding
multiple currency and interest rate instruments and assumes that financial
returns are normally distributed. Estimates of volatility and correlations of
market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics(TM) dataset as of June 30, 2001.
In cases where data is unavailable in RiskMetrics(TM) a reasonable proxy is
included.

The Company's market risk exposures relative to interest and currency rates, as
discussed below, have not changed materially versus the previous reporting
period. In addition, the Company is not aware of any facts or circumstances that
would significantly impact such exposures in the near term.

INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE
Interest rate swaps are used to hedge underlying debt obligations. Certain
currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the Company's foreign
net investments.

Based on the Company's overall interest rate exposure as of and during the year
ended June 30, 2001, including derivative and other instruments sensitive to
interest rates, a near-term change in interest rates, at a 95% confidence level
based on historical interest rate movements, would not materially affect the
Company's financial statements.

CURRENCY RATE EXPOSURE
The Company manufactures and sells its products in a number of countries
throughout the world and, as a result, is exposed to movements in foreign
currency exchange rates. The Company's major foreign currency exposures involve
the markets in Western and Eastern Europe, Asia, Mexico and Canada. The primary
purpose of the Company's foreign currency hedging activities is to manage the
volatility associated with foreign currency purchases of materials and other
assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. Corporate
policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. The Company primarily
utilizes forward exchange contracts and purchased options with maturities of
less than 18 months.

In addition, the Company enters into certain foreign currency swaps with
maturities of up to five years to hedge intercompany financing transactions. The
Company also utilizes purchased foreign currency options with maturities of
generally less than 18 months and forward exchange contracts to hedge against
the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on royalties and income from
international operations.

Based on the Company's overall currency rate exposure as of and during the year
ended June 30, 2001, including derivative and other instruments sensitive to
foreign currency movements, a near-term change in currency rates, at a 95%
confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, would not
materially affect the Company's financial statements.

COMMODITY PRICE EXPOSURE
Raw materials used by the Company are subject to price volatility caused by
weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other
unpredictable factors. The Company uses futures, option and swap contracts to
manage the volatility related to certain of these exposures. Commodity hedging
activity is not material to the Company's financial statements.

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM
Beginning in 1999 - concurrent with the Company's reorganization into
product-based global business units - the Company initiated its Organization
2005 restructuring program. The program was expanded in the current year to
deliver further cost reductions through reduced overheads, further manufacturing
consolidations, and discontinuation of under-performing businesses and
initiatives. This significant, multi-year program also is discussed in Note 2 to
the consolidated financial statements.

The total cost of the program is expected to be $5.6 billion before tax ($4.4
billion after tax). Remaining costs will be incurred through fiscal 2004, with a
significant amount of separation related costs expected to occur in the next
fiscal year. Given the nature and duration of the program, costs to be incurred
in future years are subject to varying degrees of estimation for key
assumptions, such as actual timing of execution, currency effects, enrollment
impacts and other variables. All restructuring costs are reported in the
corporate segment for management and external reporting.

Separations represent the cost of packages offered to employees to reduce
overhead and manufacturing costs, which are accrued upon employee acceptance.
The separation packages, predominantly voluntary, are formula driven based on
salary levels and past service. Separation costs are charged to costs of
products sold for manufacturing employees and marketing, research and
administrative expense for all others.

Total separations under the program are expected to be approximately 24,600.
Approximately 9,200 separations have been provided for through June 30, 2001, as
follows: 6,000 in 2001, 2,800 in 2000 and 400 in 1999. While all geographies and
businesses are impacted by the enrollment reduction programs, a higher number of
United States employees are affected, given the concentration of operations. Net
enrollment for the Company may decline by less than the total separations, as
terminations will be offset by increased enrollment at remaining sites,
acquisitions and other impacts.

Accelerated depreciation relates to long-lived assets that will be taken out of
service prior to the end of their normal service period due to manufacturing
consolidations, technology standardization, plant closures or strategic choices
to discontinue initiatives. The Company has shortened the estimated useful lives
of such assets, resulting in incremental depreciation expense. For segment and
management reporting purposes, normal depreciation expense is reported by the
business segments, with the incremental accelerated depreciation reported in the
corporate segment. Accelerated depreciation and write-downs are charged to cost
of products sold for manufacturing assets and marketing, research and
administrative expense for all other assets.

Asset write-downs relate to establishment of new fair-value bases for assets
held for sale or disposal and for assets whose future cash flow expectations
have declined significantly as a direct result of restructuring decisions.
Assets held for sale or disposal represent excess capacity that is in the
process of being removed from service and businesses held for sale within the
next 12 months. Such assets are written down to the net amount expected to be
realized upon sale or disposal. Assets expected to continue to be operated, but
whose nominal cash flows are no longer sufficient to recover existing book
values, are written down to estimated fair value, generally determined by
reference to discounted expected future cash flows. Write-downs of assets that
will continue to be used were

approximately $160 million before tax ($133 million after tax) in 2001, $0 in
2000 and $160 million before tax ($100 million after tax) in 1999. Asset
write-downs are not expected to significantly impact future annual depreciation
expense.

Other contains charges incurred as a direct result of restructuring decisions,
including relocation, training, the establishment of global business services
and the new legal and organization structure of Organization 2005, and
discontinuation of initiatives. These costs are charged to the applicable income
statement line item based on the underlying nature of the charge.

Most restructuring accruals represent current liabilities. Reserve balances were
$460 million, $88 million and $44 million at June 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. During the current year, approximately 40% of restructuring
charges were cash. Going forward, approximately 70% of future charges are
expected to be cash - primarily separations.

Savings from the restructuring program are difficult to estimate, given the
nature of the activities, the corollary benefits achieved, timing and the degree
of reinvestment. Overall, the program is expected to deliver nearly $2 billion
after tax of annual savings by fiscal 2004. Estimated incremental savings were
$235 million in 2001 and $65 million in 2000. Savings are expected to ramp up
during 2002 and are estimated to increase by approximately $600 million after
tax.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT
The Company has made and will make certain forward-looking statements in the
Annual Report and in other contexts relating to volume growth, increases in
market shares, Organization 2005, financial goals and cost reduction, among
others.

These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and estimates
regarding competitive activity, pricing, product introductions, economic
conditions, technological innovation, currency movements, governmental action
and the development of certain markets. Among the key factors necessary to
achieve the Company's goals are: (1) the successful execution of Organization
2005, including achievement of expected cost and tax savings and successful
management of organizational and work process restructuring; (2) the ability to
achieve business plans, including volume growth and pricing plans, despite high
levels of competitive activity, especially with respect to the product
categories and geographical markets in which the Company has chosen to focus;
(3) the ability to maintain key customer relationships; (4) the achievement of
growth in significant developing markets such as China, Korea, Mexico, the
Southern Cone of Latin America and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe;
(5) the ability to successfully manage regulatory, tax and legal matters,
including resolution of pending matters within current estimates; (6) the
successful and timely execution of planned brand divestitures; (7) the ability
to successfully implement cost improvement plans in manufacturing and overhead
areas; (8) the timely execution of definitive agreements and the receipt of
timely and successful regulatory clearances with respect to a transaction with
The Coca- Cola Company; (9) the timely and successful receipt of regulatory
clearances and subsequent successful integration of the Clairol business; and
(10) the ability to successfully manage currency, interest rate and certain
commodity cost exposures. If the Company's assumptions and estimates are
incorrect or do not come to fruition, or if the Company does not achieve all of
these key factors, then the Company's actual performance could vary materially
from the forward-looking statements made herein.

                  RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Consolidated financial statements and financial information included in this
report are the responsibility of Company management. This includes preparing the
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and necessarily includes estimates based on
management's best judgments.
         To help insure the accuracy and integrity of Company financial data,
management maintains internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are executed as authorized and accurately recorded and that
assets are properly safeguarded. These controls are monitored by an ongoing
program of internal audits. These audits are supplemented by a self-assessment
program that enables individual organizations to evaluate the effectiveness of
their controls. Careful selection of employees and appropriate divisions of
responsibility are designed to achieve control objectives. The Company's
"Worldwide Business Conduct Manual" sets forth management's commitment to
conduct its business affairs with the highest ethical standards.
         Deloitte & Touche, independent auditors, have audited and reported on
the Company's consolidated financial statements. Their audits were performed in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America.
         The Board of Directors, acting through its Audit Committee composed
entirely of outside directors, oversees the adequacy of internal controls. The
Audit Committee meets periodically with representatives of Deloitte & Touche and
internal financial management to review internal control, auditing and financial
reporting matters. The independent auditors and the internal auditors also have
full and free access to meet privately with the Audit Committee.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Procter & Gamble Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Procter &
Gamble Company and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2001 and 2000 and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2001. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
         We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
         In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at June
30, 2001 and 2000 and the results of its operations and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended June 30, 2001, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION: The consolidated financial statements include The Procter
& Gamble Company and its controlled subsidiaries (the Company). Investments in
companies over which the Company exerts significant influence, but does not
control the financial and operating decisions, are accounted for using the
equity method. These investments are managed as integral parts of the Company's
business units, and segment reporting reflects such investments as consolidated
subsidiaries.

USE OF ESTIMATES: Preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures.
These estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and
actions the Company may undertake in the future. Actual results may ultimately
differ from estimates.

NEW PRONOUNCEMENTS:  The Financial  Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
issued SFAS No.  133,  "Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and
Hedging  Activities"  which was adopted by the Company effective July
1, 2000. See further discussion in Note 6.

The Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 101,
"Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements," which became effective in the
fourth quarter.

During 2000 and 2001, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued: EITF No. 00-10,
"Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs" addressing the statement
of earnings classification of shipping and handling costs billed to customers;
EITF No. 00-14, "Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives" addressing the
recognition, measurement and statement of earnings classification of certain
sales incentives; and EITF No. 00-25, "Vendor Income Statement Characterization
of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendor's Products" addressing the
statement of earnings classification of consideration from a vendor to an entity
that purchases the vendor's products for resale.

There is no material impact on the Company's financial statements resulting from
application of the above new pronouncements.

In June 2001, the FASB approved two new pronouncements: SFAS No. 141, "Business
Combinations," and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS
No. 141 applies to all business combinations with a closing date after June 30,
2001. This Statement eliminates the pooling-of-interests method of accounting
and further clarifies the criteria for recognition of intangible assets
separately from goodwill.

SFAS No. 142 eliminates the amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets and initiates an annual review for impairment. Identifiable
intangible assets with a determinable useful life will continue to be amortized.
The amortization provisions apply to goodwill and other intangible assets
acquired after June 30, 2001. Goodwill and other intangible assets acquired
prior to June 30, 2001 will be affected upon adoption. The Company will adopt
SFAS No. 142 effective July 1, 2001, which will require the Company to cease
amortization of its remaining net goodwill balance and to perform an impairment
test of its existing goodwill based on a fair value concept. Although the
Company is still reviewing the provisions of these Statements, it is
management's preliminary assessment that goodwill impairment will not result
upon adoption. As of June 30, 2001, the Company has net unamortized goodwill of
$7,429 and amortization expense of $224, $214 and $180 for the years ended June
30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

REVENUE RECOGNITION: Sales are recognized when revenue is realized or realizable
and has been earned. In general, revenue is recognized when risk and title to
the product transfers to the customer, which usually occurs at the time shipment
is made.

CURRENCY TRANSLATION: Financial statements of subsidiaries outside the U.S.
generally are measured using the local currency as the functional currency.
Adjustments to translate those statements into U.S. dollars are recorded in
other comprehensive income. For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary
economies, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. Remeasurement adjustments
for highly inflationary economies and other transactional exchange gains and
losses are reflected in earnings.

CASH EQUIVALENTS: Highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or
less when purchased are considered cash equivalents.

INVENTORY VALUATION: Inventories are valued at cost, which is not in excess of
current market price. Cost is primarily determined by either the average cost or
the first-in, first-out method. The replacement cost of last-in, first-out
inventories exceeded carrying value by approximately $55 and $83 at June 30,
2001 and 2000, respectively.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS: Under current accounting guidance, the
cost of intangible assets is amortized, principally on a straight-line basis,
over the estimated periods benefited, generally forty years for goodwill and
periods ranging from three to forty years for other intangible assets. The
realizability of goodwill and other intangibles is evaluated periodically when
events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover the carrying
amount. Such evaluation is based on various analyses, including cash flow and


Millions of dollars except per share amounts

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

profitability projections that incorporate the impact of the Company's existing
businesses. The analyses necessarily involve significant management judgment to
evaluate the capacity of an acquired business to perform within projections.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: Property, plant and equipment are recorded at
cost reduced by accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is based on
estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives
are periodically reviewed, and where warranted, changes are made that result in
an acceleration of depreciation.

FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: Fair values of cash equivalents, short-
and long-term investments and short-term debt approximate cost. The estimated
fair values of other financial instruments, including debt, equity and risk
management instruments, have been determined using available market information
and valuation methodologies, primarily discounted cash flow analysis. These
estimates require considerable judgment in interpreting market data, and changes
in assumptions or estimation methods may significantly affect the fair value
estimates.

RECLASSIFICATIONS: Certain reclassifications of prior years' amounts have been
made to conform to the current year presentation.


NOTE 2 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM

Beginning in 1999 - concurrent with the Company's reorganization into
product-based global business units - the Company initiated its Organization
2005 restructuring program. The program was expanded in the current year to
deliver further cost reductions through reduced overheads, additional
manufacturing consolidations, and discontinuation of under-performing businesses
and initiatives.

Costs to be incurred include separation related costs, asset write- downs or
accelerated depreciation, and other costs directly related to the restructuring
effort.

Due to the nature of the charges and the duration of the program, estimates of
the timing and amount of costs and savings require significant judgment and may
change over time. Based on current estimates, the overall program is expected to
result in total charges of $5.6 billion ($4.4 billion after tax) over the
six-year period that began in fiscal 1999.


Before-tax restructuring charges to date are:

</TABLE>

Charges for the program are reflected in the corporate segment for management
and external reporting.

SEPARATION COSTS
Employee separation charges are related to severance packages for approximately
6,000 people in 2001, 2,800 people in 2000 and 400 people in 1999. The packages
are predominantly voluntary and are formula driven based on salary levels and
past service. Severance costs related to voluntary separations are charged to
earnings when the employee accepts the offer. The current and planned
separations span the entire organization, including manufacturing, selling,
research and administrative positions.

ASSET WRITE-DOWNS AND ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION

Asset write-downs relate to
establishment of new fair value bases for assets held for sale or disposal that
represent excess capacity in the process of being removed from service or
disposed and businesses held for sale in the next 12 months. These assets were
written down to the amounts expected to be realized upon sale or disposal, less
minor disposal costs.

Additionally, asset write-downs included certain manufacturing assets that are
expected to operate at levels significantly below their planned capacity,
primarily capital expansions related to recent initiatives that have not met
expectations. The projected cash flows

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)


from such assets over their remaining useful lives were no longer estimated to
be greater than their current carrying values; therefore, they were written down
to estimated fair value, generally determined by reference to discounted
expected future cash flows. Such charges represented approximately $160 before
tax in 2001, $0 in 2000 and $160 in 1999.

Charges for accelerated depreciation are related to long-lived assets that will
be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period due to
manufacturing consolidations, technology standardization, plant closures or
strategic choices to discontinue initiatives. The Company has shortened the
estimated useful lives of such assets, resulting in incremental depreciation
expense.

OTHER RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
Other costs incurred as a direct result of the program included relocation,
training, establishment of global business services and the new legal and
organization structure of Organization 2005, and discontinuation of initiatives.


NOTE 3 ACQUISITIONS

In 2001, acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method and totaled
$246. These acquisitions resulted in goodwill and other intangibles of $208. In
2000, the Company acquired The Iams Company and Affiliates for approximately
$2,222 in cash. Other acquisitions in 2000 totaled $745 and consisted primarily
of Recovery Engineering, Inc. and a joint venture ownership increase in China.
The 2000 acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method and resulted
in goodwill and other intangibles of $2,508. Purchase acquisitions in 1999
totaled $137.

In May 2001, the Company announced its intent to purchase the Clairol business
from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company for $4,950. The acquisition is subject to
regulatory approvals.

SELECTED OPERATING EXPENSES
Research and development costs are charged to earnings as incurred and were
$1,769 in 2001, $1,899 in 2000 and $1,726 in 1999. Advertising costs are charged
to earnings as incurred and were $3,193 in 2001, $3,793 in 2000 and $3,639 in
1999.

NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE
Net earnings less preferred dividends (net of related tax benefits) are divided
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year to
calculate basic net earnings per common share. Diluted net earnings per common
share are calculated to give effect to stock options and convertible preferred
stock.

Basic and diluted net earnings per share are reconciled as follows:

     to do so would have been antidilutive.

EQUITY PUT OPTIONS
During 2001 and 2000, the Company entered into equity put options on its common
stock. These agreements can be settled on a physical or net-share basis at the
Company's option. The premium received from the sale of the instruments is
credited to equity and reduces the Company's cash outlay for share repurchases.

The 2001 options are equivalent to one million common shares, at approximately
$74 per share. They expire in the first quarter of 2002. The options entered
into in 2000 were equivalent to 12 million common shares, at prices ranging from
$60 to $71 per share. They expired mostly unexercised in the second quarter of
2001.

Long-term weighted average interest rates were 5.0% and 6.1% as of June 30, 2001
and 2000, respectively, and include the effects of related interest rate swaps
discussed in Note 6.

The fair value of the long-term debt was $10,164 and $9,024 at June 30, 2001 and
2000, respectively. Long-term debt maturities during the next five years are as
follows: 2002--$622; 2003-- $1,117; 2004--$1,040; 2005--$1,912 and 2006 -- $32.

NOTE 6 RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

Effective July 1, 2000, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended, which requires that
all derivative instruments be reported on the balance sheet at fair value and
establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of hedging relationships.
The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 133 as of July 1, 2000 was not
material.

The Company is exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates,
currency exchange rates and commodity pricing. To manage the volatility relating
to these exposures, the Company nets the exposures on a consolidated basis to
take advantage of natural offsets. For the residual portion, the Company enters
into various derivative transactions pursuant to the Company's policies in areas
such as counterparty exposure and hedging practices. Designation is performed on
a specific exposure basis to support hedge accounting. The changes in fair value
of these hedging instruments are offset in part or in whole by corresponding
changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying exposures being
hedged. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for
trading purposes.

INTEREST RATE HEDGING
The Company's policy is to manage interest cost using a mix of fixed- and
variable-rate debt. To manage this mix in a cost efficient manner, the Company
enters into interest rate swaps in which the Company agrees to exchange, at
specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts
calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.

At June 30, 2001, the Company had swaps with a fair value of $125 designated as
fair value hedges of underlying fixed-rate debt obligations and recorded as
long-term assets. The mark-to-market values of both the fair value hedging
instruments and the underlying debt obligations are recorded as equal and
offsetting gains and losses in the interest expense component of the income
statement. All existing fair value hedges are 100% effective. As a result, there
is no impact to earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness.

Non-qualifying instruments are also recorded on the balance sheet at fair value,
but the impact was not material to the income statement.

CURRENCY RATE HEDGING
The Company manufactures and sells its products in a number of countries
throughout the world and, as a result, is exposed to movements in foreign
currency exchange rates. The Company's major foreign currency exposures involve
the markets in Western and Eastern Europe, Asia, Mexico and Canada. The primary
purpose of the Company's foreign currency hedging activities is to manage the
volatility associated with foreign currency purchases of materials and other
assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. The Company
primarily utilizes forward exchange contracts and purchased options with
maturities of less than 18 months and currency swaps with maturities up to five
years.

The Company enters into certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do
not meet hedge accounting criteria. These primarily are intended to protect
against exposure related to intercompany financing transactions and income from
international operations. The fair values of these instruments at June 30, 2001
were recorded as $136 in assets and $16 in liabilities. The net impact on
marketing, research and administrative expense was a $24 after-tax gain.

In addition, the Company utilizes purchased foreign currency options, forward
exchange contracts and cross currency swaps which qualify as cash flow hedges.
These are intended to offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on
forecasted sales, inventory purchases, intercompany royalties and intercompany
loans

[Millions of dollars except per share amounts]

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)


denominated in foreign currency. The fair values of these instruments at June
30, 2001 were recorded as $94 in assets and $101 in liabilities. Gains and
losses on these instruments are deferred in other comprehensive income (OCI)
until the underlying transaction is recognized in earnings. The earnings impact
is reported in either net sales, cost of products sold, or marketing research
and administrative expenses, to match the underlying transaction being hedged.
Qualifying cash flow hedges currently deferred in OCI are not material. These
amounts will be reclassified into earnings as the underlying transactions are
recognized. During the year the Company charged to earnings a $15 after-tax loss
due to the change in the time value of options excluded from the hedge
effectiveness test. This was prior to the change in SFAS No. 133 interpretation
that allows change in time value to be included in effectiveness testing. No
currency cash flow hedges were discontinued during the year due to changes in
expectations on the original forecasted transactions.

NET INVESTMENT HEDGING
The Company hedges its net investment position in major currencies and generates
foreign currency interest payments that offset other transactional exposures in
these currencies. To accomplish this, the Company borrows directly in foreign
currency and designates a portion of foreign currency debt as a hedge of net
investments. In addition, certain foreign currency interest rate swaps are
designated as hedges of the Company's related foreign net investments. Currency
effects of these hedges reflected in OCI produced a $460 after-tax gain during
the year, leaving an accumulated net balance of $577.

COMMODITY PRICE MANAGEMENT
Raw materials used by the Company are subject to price volatility caused by
weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other
unpredictable factors. To manage the volatility related to anticipated inventory
purchases, the Company uses futures and options with maturities generally less
than one year and swap contracts with maturities up to five years. These market
instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. The mark-to- market gain or loss
on qualifying hedges is included in other comprehensive income to the extent
effective, and reclassified into cost of products sold in the period during
which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Qualifying cash flow hedges
currently deferred in OCI are not material. These amounts will be reclassified
into earnings as the underlying transactions are recognized. The mark-to-market
gains or losses on non-qualifying, excluded and ineffective portions of hedges
are recognized in cost of products sold immediately. No cash flow hedges were
discontinued during the year ended June 30, 2001. Commodity hedging activity is
not material to the Company's financial statements.

CREDIT RISK

Credit risk arising from the inability of a counterparty to meet the terms of
the Company's financial instrument contracts is generally limited to the
amounts, if any, by which the counterparty's obligations exceed the obligations
of the Company. It is the Company's policy to enter into financial instruments
with a diversity of creditworthy counterparties. Therefore, the Company does not
expect to incur material credit losses on its risk management or other financial
instruments.


NOTE 7 STOCK OPTIONS

The Company has stock-based compensation plans under which stock options are
granted annually to key managers and directors at the market price on the date
of grant. Grants after 1998 are fully exercisable after three years and have a
fifteen-year life, while prior years' grants are fully exercisable after one
year and have a ten- year life. The Company issues stock appreciation rights in
countries where stock options are not permitted by local governments.

Pursuant to SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," the
Company has elected to account for its employee stock option plans under APB
Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." Because stock
options have been issued with exercise prices equal to grant date fair value,
compensation cost has not been recognized. Had compensation cost for the plans
been determined based on the fair value at the grant date consistent with SFAS
No. 123, the Company's net earnings and earnings per share would have been as
follows:

NOTE 8 EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

The Company maintains The Procter & Gamble Profit Sharing Trust and Employee
Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) to provide funding for two primary postretirement
benefits: a defined contribution profit sharing plan and certain U.S.
postretirement health care benefits.

The ESOP borrowed $1,000 in 1989, which has been guaranteed by the Company. The
proceeds were used to purchase Series A ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock
to fund a portion of the defined contribution plan. Principal and interest
requirements are $117 per year, paid by the trust from dividends on the
preferred shares and from cash contributions and advances from the Company. The
shares are convertible at the option of the holder into one share of the
Company's common stock. Annual credits to participants' accounts are based on
individual base salaries and years of service, and do not exceed 15% of total
participants' annual salaries and wages. The liquidation value is equal to the
issue price of $13.75 per share.

In 1991, the ESOP borrowed an additional $1,000, also guaranteed by the Company.
The proceeds were used to purchase Series B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred
Stock to fund a portion of retiree health care benefits. Debt service
requirements are $94 per year, funded by preferred stock dividends and cash
contributions from the Company. Each share is convertible at the option of the
holder into one share of the Company's common stock. The liquidation value is
equal to the issue price of $26.12 per share.

- ------------------------------------------------

Shares of the ESOP are allocated at original cost based on debt service
requirements, net of advances made by the Company to the trust. Dividends on all
preferred shares, net of related tax benefit, are charged to retained earnings.
The preferred shares held by the ESOP are considered outstanding from inception
for purposes of calculating diluted net earnings per common share.

The fair value of the Series A shares serves to reduce the Company's cash
contribution required to fund the profit sharing plan contributions earned. In
2001, allocated shares declined, primarily due to changes in debt service
requirements; this impacted the Company's cash contribution. The Series B shares
are considered plan assets of the other retiree benefits plan.


NOTE 9 POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company offers various postretirement benefits to its employees.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION RETIREMENT PLANS
Within the U.S., the most significant retirement benefit is the defined
contribution profit sharing plan described in Note 8.

OTHER RETIREE BENEFITS
The Company also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for
substantially all U.S. employees who become eligible for these benefits when
they meet minimum age and service requirements. Generally, the health care plans
require contributions.

from retirees and pay a stated percentage of expenses, reduced by deductibles
and other coverages. Retiree contributions change annually in line with health
care cost trends. These benefits are partially funded by an ESOP, as well as
certain other assets contributed by the Company.

Certain other employees, primarily outside the U.S., are covered by local
defined benefit pension, health care and life insurance plans.

The elements of the net amount recognized for the Company's postretirement plans
are summarized below:

The Company's effective income tax rate was 36.7%, 36.0% and 35.5% in 2001, 2000
and 1999, respectively, compared to the U.S. statutory rate of 35.0%. Excluding
the restructuring costs and related tax effects, the effective tax rate was
32.0%, 33.4% and 34.4% in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. This change
reflects the execution of tax planning opportunities and country mix effects.


Taxes impacted shareholders' equity with a $155 charge for the year ended June
30, 2001 and a $59 credit for the year ended June 30, 2000. Undistributed
earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be reinvested
indefinitely were $9,231 and $8,828 at June 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are comprised of the following:

As of June 30, 2001, net operating loss carryforwards totaling $995 were
available to reduce future taxable income. If unused, $415 will expire between
2002 and 2011. The remainder, totaling $580, may be carried forward
indefinitely.


NOTE 11 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company has purchase commitments for materials, supplies and property, plant
and equipment incidental to the ordinary conduct of business. In the aggregate,
such commitments are not in excess of current market prices.

The Company is subject to various lawsuits and claims with respect to matters
such as governmental regulations, income taxes and other actions arising out of
the normal course of business. The Company is also subject to contingencies
pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require
the Company to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior
manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Accrued environmental liabilities
for remediation and closure costs were $43 and $47 at June 30, 2001 and 2000,
respectively, and, in management's opinion, such accruals are appropriate based
on existing facts and circumstances. Current year expenditures were not
material.

While considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and Company
counsel, the ultimate liabilities resulting from such lawsuits and claims will
not materially affect the Company's financial statements.

which are reflected in the business segments using applicable local statutory
tax rates. Corporate assets primarily include cash, investment securities and
goodwill.

      (a)   for which the COMPANY or, with respect to INSUREDS described in
            Clause 2(e)(3) above, the NON-PROFIT OUTSIDE ENTITY actually pays
            or indemnifies or is required or permitted to pay on behalf of or
            to indemnify the INSUREDS pursuant to the charter or other similar
            formative document or by-laws or written agreements of the COMPANY
            or the NON-PROFIT OUTSIDE ENTITY duly effective under applicable
            law, that determines and defines such rights of indemnity;

            arbitration proceeding pursuant to Clause 5 (Arbitration) below
            establishes that the INSUREDS in fact gained any such personal

      (c)   for the return by the INSUREDS of any improper or illegal
            remuneration paid in fact to the INSUREDS if it shall be determined

            costs;

            below establishes that acts of active and deliberate dishonesty
            committed by the INSUREDS with actual dishonest purpose and intent
            were material to the CLAIM; however, this exclusion shall not apply
            to defense costs;

      (e)   which is insured by any other existing valid policy or policies

                  release or escape of any solid, liquid, gaseous, or thermal

                  coverage under this POLICY with respect to any such CLAIM
                  shall be specifically excess of the amount of coverage
                  available under any general liability, environmental
                  impairment or similar insurance policy with respect to such
                  CLAIM;

      (j)   by, on behalf of, at the behest of, or in the right of the COMPANY,
            if brought within the United States, Canada or their territories or
            possessions by or with the solicitation, approval, assistance or
            participation of two or more persons each of whom at the time such
            CLAIM is brought is the president, chief executive officer,
            MANAGER, chief financial officer, executive vice president or
            in-house general counsel of the COMPANY; however, this exclusion
            shall not apply if, between the starting date of the POLICY PERIOD
            and the date of the CLAIM, the COMPANY shall have undergone any of
            the events listed in subpart (a) of Clause 8 (Cancellation) or in
            Clause 22 (Bankruptcy) below, and the CLAIM is brought after the
            date of such event; or

      (i)   for any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement
            or act, omission, neglect or breach of duty by the INSUREDS while
            acting in their capacities as directors, officers, trustees,
            governors, partners, MANAGERS, employees or agents of any entity
            other than the COMPANY or by reason of their being directors,
            officers, trustees, governors, partners, MANAGERS, employees or
            agents of such other entity; however, this exclusion shall not
            apply with respect to any CLAIM for WRONGFUL ACTS by an INSURED
            serving a NON-PROFIT OUTSIDE ENTITY as described in Clause 2(e)(3)
            above.

      It is agreed that any fact pertaining to any INSURED shall not be imputed
      to any other INSURED for the purpose of determining the application of
      the Exclusions.

4.    APPEALS

      In the event the INSUREDS elect not to appeal a judgment, the INSURER may
      elect to make such appeal at its own expense, and shall be liable for any
      increased award, taxable costs and disbursements and any additional
      interest incidental to such appeal, to the extent such payments are not
      covered by other valid and collectible insurance.

5.    ARBITRATION

      (a)   My dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this
            POLICY or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof shall be
            finally and fully determined in London, England under the
            provisions of the Arbitration Acts of 1950, 1975, 1979 and 1996,
            and/or any statutory modifications or amendments thereto, for the
            time being in force, by a Board composed of three arbitrators to be
            selected for each controversy as follows:

                  Any party may, in the event of a dispute, controversy or
                  claim, notify the other party or parties to such dispute,
                  controversy or claim of its desire to arbitrate the matter,
                  and at the time of such notification the party desiring
                  arbitration shall notify the other party or parties of the
                  name of the arbitrator selected by it. The other party who
                  has been so notified shall within thirty (30) calendar days
                  thereafter select an arbitrator and notify the party desiring
                  arbitration of the name of such second arbitrator.





                                       5
<PAGE>   10


                  If the party notified of a desire for arbitration shall fail
                  or refuse to nominate the second arbitrator within thirty
                  (30) calendar days following the receipt of such
                  notification, the party who first served notice of a desire
                  to arbitrate will, within an additional period of thirty (30)
                  calendar days, apply to a judge of the High Court of Justice
                  of England and Wales for the appointment of a second
                  arbitrator and in such a case the arbitrator appointed by
                  such a judge shall be deemed to have been nominated by the
                  party or parties who failed to select the second arbitrator.
                  The two arbitrators, chosen as above provided, shall within
                  thirty (30) calendar days after the appointment of the second
                  arbitrator choose a third arbitrator. In the event of the
                  failure of the first two arbitrators to agree on a third
                  arbitrator within said thirty (30) calendar day period,
                  either of the parties may within a period of thirty (30)
                  calendar days thereafter, after notice to the other party or
                  parties, apply to a judge of the High Court of Justice of
                  England and Wales for the appointment of a third arbitrator
                  and in such case the person so appointed shall be deemed and
                  shall act as a third arbitrator. Upon acceptance of the
                  appointment by said third arbitrator, the Board of
                  Arbitration for the controversy in question shall then be
                  deemed fixed. All claims, demands, denials of claims and
                  notices pursuant to this Clause 5 shall be given in
                  accordance with Clause 16 below.

      (b)   The Board of Arbitration shall fix, by a notice in writing to the
            parties involved, a reasonable time and place for the hearing and
            may prescribe reasonable rules and regulations governing the course
            and conduct of the arbitration proceeding, including, without
            limitation, discovery by the parties.

      (c)   This POLICY, and any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of
            or relating to this POLICY, shall be governed by and construed and
            enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New
            York, except insofar as such laws: (i) may prohibit payment
            hereunder in respect of punitive damages; (ii) pertain to the
            procurement, issuance, delivery, renewal, nonrenewal or
            cancellation of policies of insurance or the regulation under New
            York Insurance Law, or regulations issued by the Insurance
            Department of the State of New York pursuant thereto, applying to
            insurers doing insurance business within the State of New York or
            as respects risks or insureds situated in the State of New York; or
            (iii) are inconsistent with any provisions of this POLICY.

            Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the provisions,
            stipulations, exclusions and conditions of this POLICY are to be
            construed in an evenhanded fashion as between the parties. Without
            limitation, where the language of this POLICY is deemed to be
            ambiguous or otherwise unclear, the issue shall be resolved in the
            manner most consistent with the relevant provisions, stipulations,
            exclusions and conditions (without regard to authorship of the
            language, without any presumption or arbitrary interpretation or
            construction in favor of either the INSUREDS or the INSURER,
            without reference to the "reasonable expectations" of either
            thereof or to contra proferentem and without reference to parol or
            other extrinsic evidence). To the extent that New York law is
            inapplicable by virtue of any exception or proviso enumerated above
            or otherwise, and as respects any arbitration procedure pursuant to
            this Clause 5, the internal laws of England and Wales shall apply.





                                       6
<PAGE>   11


      (d)   The Board of Arbitration shall, within ninety (90) calendar days
            following the conclusion of the hearing, render its decision on the
            matter or matters in controversy in writing and shall cause a copy
            thereof to be served on all the parties thereto, In case the Board
            of Arbitration fails to reach a unanimous decision, the decision of
            the majority of the members of said Board shall be deemed to be the
            decision of the Board and the same shall be final and binding on
            the parties thereto. Such decision shall be a complete defense to
            any attempted appeal or litigation of such decision in the absence
            of fraud or collusion. Without limiting the foregoing, the parties
            waive any right to appeal, an/or seek collateral review of the
            decision of the Board of Arbitration by any court or other body to
            the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

      (e)   Any order as to the costs of arbitration shall be in the sole
            discretion of the Board of Arbitration, who may direct to whom and
            by whom and in what manner the costs, shall be paid.

      (f)   The INSURER and the INSUREDS agree that in the event that claims
            for indemnity or contribution are asserted in any action or
            proceeding against the INSURER by any of the INSUREDS' other
            insurers in any jurisdiction or forum other than that set forth in
            this Clause 5, the INSUREDS will in good faith take all reasonable
            steps requested by the INSURER to assist the INSURER in obtaining a
            dismissal of these claims (other than on the merits) and will,
            without limitation, undertake to the court or other tribunal to
            reduce any judgment or award against such other insurers to the
            extent that the court or tribunal determines that the INSURER would
            have been liable to such insurers for indemnity or contribution
            pursuant to this POLICY. The INSUREDS shall be entitled to assert
            claims against the INSURER for coverage under this POLICY,
            including, without limitation, for amounts by which the INSUREDS
            reduced its judgment against such other insurers in respect of such
            claims for indemnity or contribution, in an arbitration between the
            INSURER and the INSUREDS pursuant to this Clause 5 which
            arbitration may take place before, concurrently with and/or after
            the action or proceeding involving such other insurers; provided,
            however, that the INSURER in such arbitration in respect of such
            reduction of any judgment shall be entitled to raise any defenses
            under this POLICY and any other defenses (other than jurisdictional
            defenses) as it would have been entitled to raise in the action or
            proceeding with such insurers. No determination in any such action
            or proceeding involving such other insurers shall have collateral
            estoppel, res judicata or other issue preclusion or estoppel effect
            against the INSURER in such arbitration, irrespective of whether or
            not the INSURER remained a party to such action or proceeding.

6.    ASSISTANCE AND COOPERATION

      The INSURER has no duty to defend any CLAIM and shall not be called upon
      to assume charge of the investigation; settlement or defense of any
      CLAIM, but the INSURER shall have the right and shall be given the
      opportunity to associate with the INSUREDS and the COMPANY in the
      investigation,-settlement, defense and control of any CLAIM relative to
      any WRONGFUL ACT where the CLAIM is or may be covered in whole or in part
      by this POLICY. At all times, the INSUREDS and the COMPANY and the
      INSURER shall cooperate in the investigation, settlement and defense of
      such CLAIM. The failure of the COMPANY to assist and cooperate with the
      INSURER shall not impair the rights of the INSUREDS under this POLICY.
      The INSUREDS shall not settle or admit any liability with respect to any
      CLAIM which involves or appears reasonably likely to involve this POLICY
      without the INSURER'S consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

7.    AUTOMATIC EXTENSION

      Except in the event this POLICY is cancelled in whole or in part in
      accordance with Clause 8 (Cancellation) below, on each anniversary of
      this POLICY, upon submission of the extension application and payment of
      the charged premium, this POLICY shall automatically be continued to a
      date one year beyond its previously stated expiration date, unless
      written notice is given by the INSURER to the COMPANY, or by the COMPANY
      to the INSURER, that such POLICY extension is not desired. Such written
      notice may be given at any time prior to the anniversary of the POLICY,
      except that such notice by the INSURER to the COMPANY may be given only
      during the period commencing ninety (90) days and ending ten (10) days
      prior to such anniversary, in which case the POLICY shall automatically
      expire two years from such anniversary date. Such written notice shall be
      given by the INSURER to the COMPANY only if it is determined to be
      appropriate by the Chief Executive Officer, the Executive Vice President
      for Underwriting and the Executive Vice-President for Claims of ACE
      Limited.

      If the COMPANY or the INSURER gives written notice that the POLICY
      extension is not desired, the COMPANY shall pay on or before each of the
      two remaining anniversary dates the charged premium for the next
      succeeding POLICY YEAR, respectively, less a premium credit equal to the
      premium paid for years two and three of the POLICY as specified in Item
      IV of the Declarations Page. If any such premium credit exceeds the
      charged premium, the INSURER shall refund to the COMPANY the difference
      within ten days following such anniversary date. The premium charged on
      each anniversary of this POLICY shall be determined by the rating plan
      and by-laws of the INSURER in force at such anniversary date. If during
      any POLICY YEAR the INSURER announces amendments to this standard policy
      form which are generally applicable to all similar policies issued by the
      INSURER, such amendments shall be applicable to this POLICY as of the
      second anniversary following the POLICY YEAR in which the INSURER
      announced such amendments.

8.    CANCELLATION

      This POLICY shall not be subject to cancellation except as follows:

      (a)   In the event during the POLICY PERIOD:

            (1)   the company named in Item I of the Declarations shall merge
                  into or consolidate with another organization in which the
                  company named in Item I of the Declarations is not the
                  surviving entity, or

            (2)   any person or entity or group of persons and/or entitles
                  acting in concert shall acquire securities or voting rights
                  which results in ownership or voting control by such person
                  or entity or group of persons or entities of more than 50% of
                  the outstanding securities representing the present right to
                  vote for election of directors or MANAGERS of the company
                  named in Item I of the Declarations

            this POLICY shall remain in force until the later of:

            (i)   the third anniversary of such merger, consolidation or
                  acquisition if during the POLICY PERIOD the COMPANY or the
                  INSUREDS give notice to the INSURER of their desire to elect
                  such extension (no additional premium shall be required for
                  such extension),

            (ii)  any subsequent date to which the INSURER may agree by
                  endorsement, or






                                       8
<PAGE>   13

            (iii) termination of the POLICY PERIOD,

            but only with respect to CLAIMS for WRONGFUL ACTS actually or
            allegedly taking place before the effective date of said merger,
            consolidation or acquisition. If the POLICY remains in force beyond
            the period of time stated in Item II of the Declarations by reason
            of this Clause 8(a), the LIMIT OF LIABILITY for such extension is
            part of and not in addition to the LIMIT OF LIABILITY to the
            immediately preceding POLICY YEAR. All premiums paid or due at the
            time of said merger, consolidation or acquisition shall be fully
            earned and in no respect refundable.

      (b)   This POLICY may be cancelled by the INSURER upon granting of 365
            days written notice, providing such cancellation is determined to
            be appropriate by the Chief Executive Officer, the Executive Vice
            President for Underwriting and the Executive Vice President for
            Claims of ACE Limited. Payment or tender of any unearned premium by
            the INSURER shall not be a condition precedent to the effectiveness
            of cancellation, but return of the pro rata unearned premium shall
            be made as soon as practicable.

      (c)   In the event the charged premium for any POLICY YEAR is not paid as
            provided in Clause 7 (Automatic Extension), above, this POLICY
            shall not apply to any WRONGFUL ACTS actually or allegedly taking
            place after the anniversary date on which the additional premium
            was due; however, this POLICY shall remain in force for the
            remainder of the POLICY PERIOD as to CLAIMS first made during the
            POLICY PERIOD for WRONGFUL ACTS actually or allegedly caused,
            committed or attempted prior to such anniversary date. With respect
            to all CLAIMS first made after such anniversary date, one LIMIT OF
            LIABILITY shall apply for the remainder of the POLICY PERIOD. Such
            LIMIT OF LIABILITY shall be separate from the LIMIT OF LIABILITY
            provided during the POLICY YEAR immediately preceding such
            anniversary date. All premiums paid as of such anniversary date
            shall be fully earned and in no respect refundable.

9.    CHANGES AND ASSIGNMENTS

      The terms and conditions of this POLICY shall not be waived or changed,
      nor shall an assignment of interest under this POLICY be binding, except
      by an endorsement to this POLICY issued by the INSURER.

10.   ADVANCEMENT OF DEFENSE COSTS

      Except in those instances when the INSURER has denied liability for the
      CLAIM because of the application of one or more exclusions, or other
      coverage issues, if the COMPANY refuses or is financially unable to
      advance DEFENSE COSTS, the INSURER shall, upon request and if proper
      documentation accompanies the request, advance on behalf of the INSUREDS,
      or any of them, DEFENSE COSTS that they have incurred in connection with
      a CLAIM, prior to disposition of such CLAIM. In the event that the
      INSURER so advances DEFENSE COSTS and it is finally established that the
      INSURER has no liability hereunder, such INSUREDS on whose behalf
      advances have been made and the COMPANY, to the full extent legally
      permitted, agree to repay to the INSURER, upon demand, all monies
      advanced.

11.   CURRENCY

      All premium, limits, retentions, LOSS and other amounts under this POLICY
      are expressed and payable in the currency of the United States of
      America.

12.   HEADINGS

      The descriptions in the headings and sub-headings of this POLICY are
      inserted solely for convenience and do not constitute any part of the

13.   INSUREDS' REPORTING DUTIES

      The INSUREDS and/or the COMPANY shall give written notice to the INSURER
      of any of the following as soon as practicable after the in-house general
      counsel or risk manager of the COMPANY first learns thereof:

      (a)   any CLAIM described in subpart (b) (1) of Clause 2 (Definitions)
            above, which notice shall include the nature of the WRONGFUL ACT,
            the alleged injury, the names of the claimants, and the manner in
            which the INSUREDS or COMPANY first became aware of the CLAIM; or

      (b)   any event described in subpart (a) of Clause 8 (Cancellation)
            above,

      The INSUREDS and the COMPANY shall cooperate with the INSURER and give
      such additional information as the INSURER may reasonably require.

14.   LOSS PROVISIONS

      (a)   The time when a CLAIM shall be made for purposes of determining the
            application of Clause 1 (Insuring Clause) above shall be the date
            on which the CLAIM is first made against the INSURED.

      (b)   If during the POLICY PERIOD, the INSUREDS or the COMPANY shall
            become aware of any circumstances that are likely to give rise to a
            CLAIM being made against the INSUREDS and shall give written notice
            to the INSURER of the circumstances and the reasons for
            anticipating a CLAIM, with particulars as to dates and persons
            involved, then any CLAIM that is subsequently made against the
            INSUREDS arising out of such circumstances shall be treated as a
            CLAIM made during the first POLICY YEAR in which the INSUREDS or
            the COMPANY gave such notice.

      (c)   The COMPANY and the INSUREDS shall give the INSURER such
            information and cooperation as it may reasonably require and as
            shall be in the COMPANY'S and the lNSUREDS' power.


15.   OTHER INSURANCE

      Subject to subparts (e) and (f) of Clause 3 (Exclusions) above, if other
      valid and collectible insurance with any other insurer, whether such
      insurance is issued before, concurrent with, or after inception of this
      POLICY, is available to the INSUREDS covering a CLAIM also covered by
      this POLICY, other than insurance that is issued specifically as
      insurance in excess of the insurance afforded by this POLICY, this POLICY
      shall be in excess of and shall not contribute with such other insurance.
      Without limiting the foregoing, this POLICY is specifically excess of and
      shall not contribute with any insurance which is maintained by a
      NON-PROFIT OUTSIDE ENTITY and available to an INSURED. Nothing herein
      shall be construed to make this POLICY subject to the terms of other
      insurance.

      represent them with respect to the CLAIM, including giving and receiving
      of notice of CLAIM and other correspondence, the receiving of LOSS
      payments, and the submission of a dispute to arbitration.

18.   SEVERABILITY

      (a)   The APPLICATION for coverage shall be construed as a separate
            APPLICATION for coverage by each INSURED. With respect to the
            declarations and statements contained in such APPLICATION for
            coverage, no statement in the APPLICATION or knowledge possessed by
            any one INSURED shall be imputed to any other INSURED for the
            purpose of determining the availability of coverage with respect to
            CLAIMS made against any other INSURED.

            The acts, omissions, knowledge, or warranties of any INSURED shall
            not be imputed to any other INSURED with respect to the coverages
            applicable under this POLICY.

      (b)   This POLICY shall not be rescinded by the INSURER in whole or in
            part based upon the restatement of, or any misstatement or error
            in, any financial statements of the COMPANY contained within the
            APPLICATION.

      (c)   In the event that any provision of this POLICY shall be declared or
            deemed to be invalid or unenforceable under any applicable law,
            such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the validity or
            enforceability of the remaining portion of this POLICY.

19.   SPOUSAL LIABILITY

      If a CLAIM against an INSURED includes a claim against the INSURED'S
      lawful spouse solely by reason of (i) such spouse's status as a spouse of
      the INSURED, or (ii) such spouse's ownership interest in property which
      the claimant seeks as recovery for alleged WRONGFUL ACTS of the INSURED,
      all loss which such spouse becomes legally obligated to pay by reason of
      such CLAIM shall be treated for purposes of this POLICY as LOSS which the
      INSURED becomes legally obligated to pay by reason of the CLAIM made
      against the INSURED. Such spousal loss shall be covered under the POLICY
      only if and to the extent such loss would be covered if incurred by the
      INSURED.

      The coverage extension afforded by this Clause 19 does not apply to the
      extent such CLAIM alleges a wrongful act or omission by the INSURED's
      spouse.

20.   SUBROGATION

      In the event of any payment under this POLICY, the INSURER shall be
      subrogated to the extent of such payment to all the INSUREDS' rights of
      recovery, and the INSUREDS shall execute all papers reasonably required
      and shall take all reasonable actions that may be necessary to secure
      such rights including the execution of such documents necessary to enable
      the INSURER effectively to bring suit in the name of the INSUREDS,
      including but not limited to an action against the COMPANY for nonpayment
      of indemnity due and owing to the INSUREDS by the COMPANY.

21.   ACQUISITION, CREATION OR DISPOSITION OF A SUBSIDIARY

      (a)   Coverage shall apply to the INSUREDS of any subsidiary corporation
            or limited liability company in which more than 50% of the
            outstanding securities representing the present right to vote for
            election of directors or MANAGERS is owned, directly or indirectly,
            in any combination, by the COMPANY and/or one or more of its
            SUBSIDIARIES, and which is acquired or created after the inception
            of this POLICY, if written notice is given to the INSURER within
            sixty (60) days after the acquisition or creation, and any
            additional premium required by the INSURER is paid within thirty
            (30) days of the request therefor by the INSURER. The INSURER
            waives the obligation to provide notice and to pay any additional
            premium if the assets of such newly created or acquired company are
            not more than 15% of the total assets of the COMPANY or
            $500,000,000, whichever is less. The coverage provided for the
            INSUREDS of such new subsidiary shall be limited to CLAIMS for
            WRONGFUL ACTS actually or allegedly taking place subsequent to the
            date of acquisition or creation of the subsidiary.

      (b)   Coverage shall not apply to directors, MANAGERS, officers and
            employees of any subsidiary, including a SUBSIDIARY as defined in
            Clause 2 (Definitions) above, for CLAIMS for WRONGFUL ACTS actually
            or allegedly taking place subsequent to the date that the COMPANY
            and/or one or more of its SUBSIDIARIES, directly or indirectly, in
            any combination, ceases to own more than 50% of the outstanding
            securities representing the present right to vote for election of
            directors or MANAGERS in such subsidiary.

22.   BANKRUPTCY

      In the event a liquidation or reorganization proceeding is commenced by
      or against a COMPANY pursuant to the United States Bankruptcy Code, as
      amended, or any similar state or local law, the COMPANY and the INSUREDS
      hereby (i) waive and release any automatic stay or injunction which may
      apply in such proceeding to this POLICY or its proceeds under such
      Bankruptcy Code or law, and (ii) agree not to oppose or object to any
      efforts by the INSURER, the COMPANY or any INSURED to obtain relief from
      any such stay or injunction.

      In the event the COMPANY becomes a debtor in possession under the United
      States Bankruptcy Code or an equivalent status under the law of any other
      country and the aggregate LOSS due under this POLICY exceeds the
      remaining available LIMIT OF LIABILITY, the INSURER shall:

      (a)   first pay such LOSS allocable to WRONGFUL ACTS that are actually or
            allegedly caused, committed, or attempted prior to the COMPANY
            becoming a debtor in possession, then

      (b)   with respect to whatever remaining amount of the LIMIT OF LIABILITY
            is available after payment under (a) above, pay such LOSS allocable
            to WRONGFUL ACTS that are actually or alleged caused, committed, or
            attempted after the COMPANY became a debtor in possession.
