continually strives maintain right balance appropriate measures promote both convenience security customers identity thieves those committing fraud using stolen credit card bank account numbers potentially steal large amounts money from businesses such paypal believe that several paypals current former competitors electronic payments business have gone business significantly restricted their businesses largely losses from this type fraud while paypal uses advanced anti fraud technologies expect that technically knowledgeable criminals will continue attempt circumvent paypals anti fraud systems using increasingly sophisticated methods addition paypals service could subject employee fraud other internal security breaches paypal required reimburse customers funds stolen result such
